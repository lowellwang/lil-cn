You&#39;re seated upon a plush bench seat, hand pressed to the glass of the capsule roaring downward towards a planet that stretches beyond the horizon.  Far less convenient than landing directly, but you know that isn&#39;t possible.  Men defied the Gods of this world once, but do so again at their own peril.  This is the only way.\n\n[[Strange...where am I?-&gt;Where am I?]]",
  "Where am I?": "&lt;img alt=&quot;bedroom&quot; src=&quot;images/land/bedroom.png&quot;/&gt;\n\nYour eyes open, as your mind grapples with a question so fundamental.  The world is bleary but the data comes in, sharpening with every passing second.  A ceiling.  You&#39;re staring at a pristine white ceiling, the inner portion recessed, swirling etchings defining the boundary.  The headache persists but your body doesn&#39;t register the same problems, and tries to rise.  Only to fail, muscles suddenly straining.  Through the lingering fog of your mind you look down, and the situation becomes clearer.\n\nYou&#39;re laying on a bed, the sheets smooth and glossy, nothing like the silk and satins you&#39;re more familiar with.  *Nude*.  From your toes to the flare of your waist, up past a pert chest.  Worse, you&#39;re bound, arms and legs spread by the chains linking each to the corner posts of the bed.\n\n[[Consider the situation further.-&gt;The Mirror]]\n[[Forget that, struggle!-&gt;Forget that, struggle!]]\n[[Scream!-&gt;Scream!]]",
  "The Mirror": "&lt;img alt=&quot;player&quot; src=&quot;images/reg/player.png&quot;/&gt;\n\nInstead of further physical efforts, your rational mind asserts itself.  First things first: you //really// give your situation proper examination.\n\nSome of the details you already know.  You&#39;re on a bed with peculiar, slick sheets.  They&#39;re white, same as the ceiling above.  And you&#39;re bound at wrist and ankle by simple cuffs.\n\nLooking around, the rest of the room shows a similar decor-- clean lines, smooth surfaces, a strictly modern aesthetic.  An end table beside the bed features a projected clock against the wall, reading &#39;&#39;GOOD MORNING&#39;&#39;.  Several other items rest upon the table itself, but they&#39;re above your head, only vague shapes from your current vantage.\n\nIt&#39;s the mirror visible across from the foot of the bed that truly gives perspective.  In its silvered visage you see yourself, a woman bound lewdly upon the bed.  Your hair is a bit beyond shoulder length and blonde, well-kept but currently disheveled, falling across your shoulders in a wild wave.  A gag is visible as well, the white material covering the space from nose to chin like a panel.  Between your teeth, the presence of a ball being lodged beneath is obvious.  You&#39;re quite literally bound and gagged, all but helpless-- for a designated length of time, you realize.  Hidden from your eyes, but visible in the reflection is a second projection from the end-stand clock:\n\n&#39;&#39;Binding Release: 29/50 hours remaining.&#39;&#39;\n\n[[I&#39;ve been here for nearly a day?-&gt;Mirror II]]",
  "Forget that, struggle!": "Your senses may still be reeling from the revelation, but your muscles know what to do.  Pulling hard, you struggle against the bindings keeping you upon the bed.  The chains rattle, your cuffs pull just a bit tighter, and then...\n\n...nothing.  Despite your efforts, they do not give.  You&#39;re left panting, but do get a look at the d-shaped rings to which the chains have been attached, built into each of the bed posts.  A strange accessory, as if it were made for just this sort of situation.\n\n[[Perhaps you should consider the situation.-&gt;The Mirror]]\n[[Scream!-&gt;Scream!]]",
  "Scream!": "A high-pitched scream forms in your chest, rises up your throat-- and dies in a muffled //mmmph// as you suddenly realize that the cuffs were not the only binding you wore.  Staring up at the ceiling you work your jaw, your tongue.  The gag is smooth and ball-shaped, seated just behind your teeth.  A further portion covers your mouth and wraps beneath your chin, a panel holding it in place.  You&#39;re limited to muffled moans, and nothing more.\n\n[[You can still struggle!-&gt;Forget that, struggle!]]\n[[Perhaps you should consider things.-&gt;The Mirror]]",
  "Mirror II": "That appears to be correct.  You try to recall anything from that time period, but nothing comes.  It&#39;s as if you&#39;ve walked to the edge of the abyss, staring into an emptiness so vast, so terrifying.  What had happened?  How had you come to this?  //Who are you?//\n\nThat last bit at least pulls you back from the brink, escaping the inky darkness that proves to be only your //short// term memory.  Holes are punched in anything further back than perhaps a week, but beyond that some answers do come when queried.  You&#39;re in your twenties, born on the colony of Urzan Tor IV.  Tor-Four, as the colloquialism went, had been the very definition of a backwater.  You had escaped to greener pastures as soon as you could pull together enough for passage on a dragship, entering the service of Steris Trans-Galactic, a major research and development firm.  But you&#39;re hardly a scientist, no, you&#39;re what&#39;s known as a //prospector.//  Not of mineral deposits, mind you, but of breakthroughs and technologies tucked away on the fringes of known space.  With a hint of new frontiers and a suitcase, you&#39;ve been rising through the ranks by coming back with deeds and contracts for all sorts of new discoveries.  Even Backwaters like Tor-Four hold interesting things, after all, but it takes a prospector to bring them to market.  That&#39;s you.\n\n[[Then how the hell did I end up like THIS?-&gt;Mirror III]]",
  "Mirror III": "&lt;img alt=&quot;torei&quot; src=&quot;images/land/torei.png&quot;/&gt;\n\n//Torei.//\n\nThe name comes to you, but that&#39;s damn close to the black hole in your memories.  Infamous among spacers, and those with an interest in the fringes.  A lost world, only relatively recently put back on the map.  A perverse world, known for the intensive sexuality that was its culture and main export, as well as the presence of widespread slavery.  But a &#39;&#39;lucrative&#39;&#39; world, if one braved its dangers.  Torei&#39;s strange history had left it with biomedical technology perhaps centuries ahead of anything available on the wider intergalactic market, and a distinct need for all sorts of foreign inventions in turn.  A prospector&#39;s dream, but a terribly difficult task for any one person.\n\nTorei had a thriving tourist culture, and besides a strict ban on planet-side landings (thus the need for a space elevator descent), meeting with the locals was easy enough.  Ringdoms circled the planet&#39;s equator, each a nation unto itself.  Culturally similar of course, but varying widely between the traditionalist and suspicious antipodes and those near the elevator, who welcomed outsiders with opened hands-- always willing to trade.  But Torei&#39;s humans did not hold the keys to their own planet, and they certainly did not offer much of their best tech.\n\nThat only came from the poles.  From the Gods.  Mazos and Dahom.\n\nFar from civilization the twinned AIs ruled.  Some Toreans called them Gods, others merely machines.  Most fear them, and for good reason.  Torean history speaks at length to the time before liberty, where the AIs ruled and humans served, little more than nameless cogs in a planetary machine.  Endless suffering, torture, experimentation.  But everyone knew they were the absent Kings of Torei.  A majority of their subjects had escaped them, a war had ensued to confirm that fact, but they still held secrets.  Technology...  you came here to make a deal, that&#39;s clear.  \n\n[[Was that deal with them?-&gt;Mirror IV]]",
  "Mirror IV": "You may not remember much, but you do conclude quickly you are not *that* foolish.  Researching Torei from afar was notoriously difficult, but you just know you would have taken precautions, dealt with locals you could negotiate with over mad AI gods.  But what sort of deal had you struck, and with whom?\n\nThat you can&#39;t fully remember.  Again you had trended close to the holes in your memory, and this time you had plunged through.  Perhaps that was for the best, as you laid upon the bed, limbs spread towards all four corners-- you have a more immediate concern.  Twenty nine hours of bondage, it seemed, if you could not escape before that.  Obviously that would not do.  What if someone walked in?  Were you being held against your will?  You need answers.  You &#39;&#39;must&#39;&#39; escape.  But how?\n\nExamining your bindings reveals them to be well constructed, solid pieces of work.  They&#39;re not locked, but you have so little movement you couldn&#39;t even begin to undo them without having a hand free.  Eyeing the d-rings holding your chains to the bed reveals one of them, that attached to your left hand cuff, to look a bit loose however.  Perhaps you could work it free?\n\nThe only other option is made apparent by the mirror, which allows you to both see yourself and the area around the bed itself.  There appears to be a remote of some sort lying on the ground to the right side of your bed.  It would take some time, and you don&#39;t know what it would actually accomplish, but the glossy sheet of the bed you&#39;re pinned to is quite heavy.  If bunched up and pushed off, it should depress several of the buttons on the device.\n\n[[Try to break that D-Ring.-&gt;Ring I]]\n[[Try for the button.-&gt;Button I]]",
  "Ring I": "Your bindings are taut, the range of movement allowed to your limbs quite limited indeed.  But by shifting your wrist, swinging it between the tightest points of restraint, you are able to snap the ring back and forth.

  "Button I": "You&#39;ve settled on trying the buttons.  A quick test confirms your hypothesis: the topmost sheet of the bed is slick and smooth, but your bare skin can shift it.

The Wardrobe was ensuring your head remained up, but you&#39;re hit with the immediate sensation that was no longer necessary-- the collar would ensure your posture going forward.\n\nYet another component of your outfit comes with the sensation of your own feet rising, the sensation unequal and primarily at your heel.

  "PlayRev": "&quot;Ah yes,&quot; the woman before you nods.  &quot;Reverence is an ancient Torean custom.  Were I in control of the Way Up, I would demand instructions on it be given to every arriving offworlder.  Any Torean worth being collared by will demand you practice it, after all.  So what exactly is a reverence?&quot;\n\nShe pauses to draw another inhalation of her sweetly scented electronic cigarette.  &quot;Some call it the Torean curtsy.  In short: as a woman, slave or freewomb, it is expected during any greeting or parting through which you are interacting with a superior in social rank.  How you approach it is largely dependent on your clothing, however.  And your bondage.  The *classic* reverence is done if you are wearing a skirt, whereupon you spread your legs-- watching the distance carefully, too far and it is considered wanton, whoreish-- and lift your skirt to present your womanhood to the other person.  It does not matter if you are thus bared, or wearing panties, or even chastity.  The purpose is merely to present your current situation.  During this, you lower your eyes, and depending on the social status of the person opposite you bow.  Just a hint for a peer, further for someone of authority-- further still in formal situations, or if you are in the presence of any free male.&quot;\n\nIsabella gestures towards your outfit.  &quot;In your case?

Then, in casual encounters you would spread your legs and press your hips forward, present your zipper as best you can.  In formal circumstances you would kneel, legs spread.]&quot;\n\n[[&quot;Reverence... got it.&quot;-&gt;IsPlayE Hub]]",
  "PlayCurfew": "Like a reigning schoolmistress, Isabella tips her head in a sage-like fashion.  &quot;Of course.  Each Ringdom is different, and a handful do not hold such rules... but most do, including this one.  Curfew applies to all women of majority, and effectively demands we not travel outdoors after dark unescorted.&quot;\n\nShe sighs.  &quot;It is one of the more troublesome laws, truth be told.  A legal escort must be male, and even with you offworlders coming in there are still precious few men.  You must be leashed as well, and obviously there is a very real power dynamic involved there.  Alternatives are a freewomb curfew exemption, a thing *very* rarely given, using point-to-point transport such as a carriage... or the Lead.  Generally I utilize a carriage, but if say I were to attend a fancy gala a male escort would be expected.  High society thrives on discussions of which man you have acquired for such things... or been forced to submit to.&quot;\n\n[[&quot;I believe I understand.&quot;-&gt;IsPlayE Hub]]",
  "PlayMen": "&quot;You want to discuss *men*,&quot; Isabella replies, taking an amused tone.  &quot;All women do, eventually.&quot;\n\nShe settles into her lesson with a slight shift of her seated position to become more comfortable.  &quot;You may or may not remember, given your situation, that men on Torei are rare-- generally one existing for every ten women.  This gives them power, and the laws of most Ringdoms only further that.  As long as they are not slaves, and few are, they are not subjected to curfew.  They are excluded from most Ministry of Truancy spot checks and detainment.  And earning credits is hardly difficult for them, a night providing legal escort is often enough for someone to live comfortably for a week.&quot;\n\nHer legs shift, uncrossing, then crossing again.  &quot;When interacting with a man, understand that you are subservient to him even if you have no formal contract or relation.  If he wishes to touch you, it would generally be unwise to resist.  If he seeks your favor, consider his intentions carefully.  He has limits, but they are... far more nebulous then those you have, as a woman.  Ah, always perform reverence to men, Toreans will expect that.&quot;\n\nShe smiles.  &quot;I have read of how things are where you come from.  Remember that it is *very* different here.

Like most other Ministries on Torei, the Ministry of Improvements operates in many Ringdoms and provides a particular service: alteration of the human body.\n\n&quot;I do not intend to provide you with a history lesson, but suffice it to say that Torei has far more advanced medical technology then the galaxy abroad, due to the presence of the AIs.  Thus the improvement of our bodies is largely seen as a trivial matter.  Simple aesthetic changes are common, adjusting your breasts or hips for instance, or the color of your eyes.  Few Toreans retain their strictly natural attributes for long after their majority,&quot; she notes.  &quot;Especially slaves.

Where once you may have had to offer payment or negotiate with the Officer, now Isabella handles it all, even presenting your SLAVE-marked ID when prompted.  \n\n&quot;Remember to keep it on that leash,&quot; the Officer reminds your owner as together you&#39;re waved through.\n\nAgain Isabella leads the way as you approach the sleek trains, boarding a car she chooses.

Isabella had promised to let you finish your last deal, if you desired, but there would be no triumphant escape from Torei via the Way Up afterward.  A contract would make your mere presence in the massive terminal at its base illegal-- slaves were strictly prohibited, you remember seeing a sign that declared that.

Those facilities turn out to be several bathrooms, one marked for Men, one for Freewombs, and one for Slaves-- alongside a row of Wardrobe Devices.  Changing outfits after or just prior to a trip seems to be common.\n\nIsabella selects an open Wardrobe for you, using her own credentials to bring up a far more extensive catalog of options then you had seen at the Hotel.  She pays a substantial fine for the early removal of your current outfit, the brief look at her account showing a *very* large balance.  Meanwhile, a warning flashes in response to her selection of the standardized slave suit:\n\n(font: &quot;courier new&quot;)[(color: cyan)[*This is a standardized Slave-Rated Wardrobe outfit, as described in the Aekoran Slave Codes, Chapter 812, subsection 10.

  "GetSlave3": "You know the drill by this point, the arms the emerge once the door closes behind you almost like old friends.  They grip your wrists, your ankles, and your throat as the machine truly revs up.  The first step is a simple one, demonstrating the utility of the drain beneath you: a solvent dissolves your suit, your bindings, everything-- in a matter of seconds.  Only metals or other installed components remain, but those are plucked by a pair of waiting arms as they fall to the floor.  Recycling!\n\nThe urge is there to close your eyes, as if ignorance could prevent what was about to occur.  Is this *really* what you wanted?  But your confidence holds, allowing you the only seat in the house as the show begins. Further mechanical arms and implements emerge, the largest being a ring wide enough that it barely fit the small room.  It hovers above you, a far too large halo, waiting only for an attendant arm to strategically place your blonde hair before the device descends.\n\nNozzles built into the ring emit a pungent substance as soon as it descends past the crown of your head.  For a moment you think it paint, and it does adhere like the stuff, but the sensation is fleeting-- as following the emitters a white-light laser passes over the freshly applied material, and it flash-cools.  What had been a thick spray is now a thin, slick, glossy material.  Holes at your mouth, nose, and eyes are quickly excised.  Cold upon your skin, but already your body is warming it up.  Torei&#39;s all but sacred material, its most readily available substance: **laminate.**\n\nThus your suit is quiet literally printed on, the base layer a solid midnight black.  The ring descends bit by bit, rendering soft flesh into equally soft but so very *different* laminate.  Secondary arms follow it down, providing spot treatment along seams and friction points-- although often the effect is for merely aesthetic purposes.  Sometimes that takes the form of a second application of laminate, other times it lingers to produce something more substantial-- such as the zipper between your legs, the tiny metal components pre-formed and merely placed by the rapid-fire staccato movements of a particularly agile mechanized arm.\n\nYou&#39;re given no time to rest as the base layer concludes, the ring rapidly ascending as other arms move into the space to begin work on the most intensive component of your outfit: the corset.  Several times the arms work along your midsection, printing in thick black material, before pre-forged strips of steel emerge.  Those would be the bones that ensured a corset could trim the waist effectively, and once submerged into the thick material a final flash of light sets the material.  Its not until synthetic lacing is carefully worked in a pattern through the holes along your back that the device actually begins to function, however.  With every tug it grows tighter, never painful, but definitely uncomfortable.  By the time the Wardrobe concludes, your chest is thrust out in response, while your back is straight and breathing takes some effort.\n\n[[And it only continues...-&gt;Get Slave 4B]]",
  "Get Slave 4": "No.  One last accessory remains, having been listed on the original selection as... **inserts**.\n\nAdrenaline shoots through your system as the Wardrobe realigns itself again, this time positioning two large arms, one before your lower torso, the other just behind it.  Long, thick cylinder-like forms begin to extrude from the arms, taking the shape of what you recognize quite immediately as masculine physiology.  As they work, another more nimble arm presses forward, seizing upon the only zipper on your suit.  A mathematically simple arc carries it down between your legs, exposing a set of holes matched so perfectly to the now fully formed dildos.  Your body tenses as a syrup-like lubricant is applied to each.\n\n(set: $Slave to true)(set: $Blue to false)(set: $Smoke to false)(set: $Sec to false)(set: $Brand to false)(set: $Gear to 5)\n\n[[Focus on your breathing.-&gt;GetSlave 5]]",
  "GetSlave 5": "No further warning is given.  With sudden explosive action, the inserts drive forward.  They find the waiting holes readily enough, then twist, as if screwing their way into your body.  Despite yourself a moan escapes your ruby red (and masked) lips as you&#39;re pierced from both ends.  They plunge further, and further-- your mind screams for an end, your body assures you it cannot take anymore.  Yet it does.  Still further, further, further...\n\nUntil you&#39;re hilted on the ends, hips swaying minutely as you try fruitlessly to adapt to the sensation.  It may be amusing in retrospect, if you ever allow yourself to remember this moment, how gentle the final arm is that pulls your zipper closed again.  A small padlock on the end is almost an afterthought.\n\nThen, with a final flash of white light and a conclusive hiss, the armatures withdraw.\n\nYou collapse to your knees, the short distance an altogether new experience as your inserts shift deep within your cunt and rear.  Again you moan, this time frustrated with yourself as you try to focus, breathing hard against the stricture of your mask.  It takes several minutes, but eventually you find yourself watching the tight, glossy material covering your chest gently rise and fall.  Your posture is ensured by the corset, while also making each breath a bit of an effort, at least until your body adapted.  The sensation of the laminate is almost otherworldly as well, light pressure upon your body from toe to head, a lover&#39;s embrace you cannot escape.

There is a reason for that.&quot;  He pulls at his jacket&#39;s collar a bit, obviously uncomfortable.  &quot;The photoshoot is supposed to generate awareness for slaves and freewombs, and the bondage you undergo here.  But the local authorities are, obviously, resistant to our activities.  It is not what we would prefer, but we have managed to achieve a compromise of sorts: they allow us to operate if we ensure our photoshoots and the like show *real* Torean scenarios.

You enter into what appears to be an office space of some sort, subdivided and rented out.  The Liberty Society&#39;s section is small, and currently deserted, but packed with supplies-- you get the clear impression Michael isn&#39;t its only member operating on Grand Aekora&#39;s outskirts.  Passing by several boxes of pamphlets much like the ones your escort had been handing out, you notice one of a different style, the name *Convent of Perception* written in stark letters along the top.\n\nYour attention turns towards the back of the domicile, however, where a familiar device awaits-- a wardrobe, this one appearing to be mobile.  Michael works the control panel as you step up, the door gliding open before you.  Within, a dozen different armatures await.\n\n[[Step forward.-&gt;Remove Suit 3]]",
  "Remove Suit 3": "You&#39;re seized as soon as you enter, the door snapping shut behind.  Much like the hotel&#39;s Wardrobe, this one has a drain in the bottom of the unit, its use revealed by the first stage of your re-dressing-- the removal.  Instead of peeling the laminate from your body, a simple solvent is applied by a spraying arm, and in mere moments the material is dripping off your body like so much wet paint.  \n\nRemoving your plugs is a different matter-- that requires a pair of arms to seize them directly, but as you squirm in your restraints they&#39;re pulled free from your tortured cunt.  You take a deep breath, the first in some time, as you are no longer masked.  A brief, tantalizing taste of nudity follows... but not for long.  With a fresh whirl, the Wardrobe begins working on your new outfit as a ring descends from above.\n\nThus your outfit is quiet literally printed on, first applying bright white but transitioning to an equally vibrant shade of red as it passes your waist and forms a stylish pencil skirt.  The ring descending bit by bit, rendering soft flesh into equally soft but so very *different* laminate.  Secondary arms follow it down, providing spot treatment along seams and friction points-- although often the effect is for merely aesthetic purposes.  Sometimes that takes the form of a second application of laminate, other times it lingers to produce something more substantial-- such as the small folded collar just beneath your chin, or the buttons that almost immediately strain to keep your bust constrained by your bodice.\n\nYou&#39;re given no time to rest as the base layer concludes, the ring rapidly ascending as other arms move into the space to begin work on your accessories.  The peplum skirt you saw pictured is thus formed, starting with the belt at your waist.  Small pre-forged rivets are sunk into the still molten laminate before it is sealed, as is the belt loop that is seated directly over your naval.  Still held in place, small arms flair the laminate that extends over your rear, achieving the look most of the galaxy would label as *slutty* but Torei saw as merely coquettish.\n\nThe final component of your outfit comes with the sensation of your own feet rising, the sensation unequal and focused primarily at your heel.  Without the restraint arms you would have toppled over, but they hold you tight, tall heels being extruded into place.  More red laminate follows, coating your feet excepting the stylish hole at the very front.\n\nAlmost as an afterthought, makeup is applied last.  Mechanical arms seize your head, holding it tight as nozzles approach your face.  A quick blast of air instinctively causes your eyes to close, and in that brief moment the Wardrobe does its work.  Your eyelids have been darkened, a crimson secondary coat added that flashed only when light slid across it.  Pores and blemishes have been rendered impotent as well, while your cheekbones have been highlighted.  And your lips are now a poignant, inviting red.\n\n(if: $Level is &gt; 0)[The only remaining step is the reapplication of your bondage, the hobble chain at your ankles (if: $Level is &gt; 1)[and armbinder behind you] being quickly build back up.]\n\nThen, with a final flash of white light and a conclusive hiss, the armatures withdraw.\n\n[[You emerge.-&gt;Remove Suit 4]]",

Once more you&#39;re allowed to breathe freely, regulation no longer being applied by mask and corset.  You&#39;ve also been liberated from the consistent teasing of the infernal plugs, although curiously your tortured womanhood almost seems to ache from their absence.  Most importantly, though, you will no longer be recognized as little better then a slave-- the outfit you&#39;re now wearing instead at least approaches the Torean definition of *professional.*  And your ID has reset to its original picture, without obscuring mask.\n\n(border-color: cyan)+(border: &quot;dotted&quot;)+(corner-radius: 8)[ID Chit Updated!]\n\nIt&#39;s a change that Michael clearly approves of immediately, a fact he demonstrates by giving you an enthusiastic thumbs up.\n\n&quot;Very good!

In the center of the makeshift stage, three poles run from ceiling to floor.  Two are... occupied.\n\nIn the center a girl in a pink laminate dress has her hands bound behind her back, a shiny ring gag pressed between her teeth, forcing her mouth open.  The cups of her dress have been pulled down, both revealing her pierced nipples and stripping her of anything approaching dignity.  Her expression is a mixture of frustrated and distraught, but it takes you a moment to recognize *why* beyond the obvious causes-- but you eventually do notice a laminate cord, running down from the top of her pole, then down behind her back.  Just what purpose that cord served is demonstrated by the second woman.\n\nMuch like the first, this second unfortunate has her own pole, her hands bound behind her back.  Her laminate outfit is a pale blue, her breasts likewise exposed.  Unlike her compatriot in bondage, however, she isn&#39;t standing angrily-- she&#39;s *hanging*.  Her legs are folded up, straps encircling her thighs (and thus her calves), one to each side her pole.  And the cord from above?  She doesn&#39;t have a skirt to hide the fact that it was connected to a heavy device currently installed in her ass, supporting her weight entirely.  Her head is bowed, drool running from her gagged mouth to the floor.\n\n[[&quot;Oh no.&quot;-&gt;OffPhoto5]]\n[[&quot;Uh...

Raven haired and pretty, her opened mouth drools a bit onto the floor, her eyes trying to stay focused.  This much closer, you can see the telltale red marks of some device-- whip or crop-- along her flanks.  She&#39;s standing on her toes, barely, the toes of her boots barely managing to hold her steady.  That last bit, *steady*, is demonstrated to be quite important when the Governess uses her shoulder to push her to the side.  She pivots, moaning desperately, without the footing to halt the process despite her muted attempts to do so.  \n\n&quot;Your ID indicates you&#39;re... quite new to Torei,&quot; the Governess explains, flicking the thick laminate cord to which the steel that emerged from the girl&#39;s ass attached.  The cord thrums in response, and so does your fellow freewomb, the sound pleading.  &quot;You&#39;ve probably not seen an anal hook in person, but that&#39;s what is buried inside her.

  "AskCov": "&quot;Ah, a proper question to ask, considering where we stand.&quot;  Sister Euphoria&#39;s arms stretch out, the tight cling of most of her uniform offset by the loose draping of her cloak.  &quot;You are standing in the vestibule of the Covenant of Perception.&quot;\n\nShe gestures towards a set of doors on the far side of the small clearing, mostly obscured by the wave-like leaf-analogues.  &quot;Through there would be our chambers of prayer, open to all those will to submit to a particular program.  Contemplation, Sensation, and Revelation being offered here.  Further in would be the Order&#39;s chambers, and other more private prayer areas.\n\n&quot;The Order maintains a number of Covenants such as this across Torei, each dedicated to a particular ideal and serving a variety of public programs.  As a whole the Order is dedicated to achieving Bliss, but approaching such things directly is very difficult.  Thus the ideals, where Sisters can contemplate and explore individual facets of the greater whole more readily.  Our ideal here, as the name suggests, is *Perception.*&quot;\n\n[[&quot;That&#39;s all I wanted to know, thank you.&quot;-&gt;AskCon]]\n[[&quot;What exactly do you mean by &#39;Perception.&#39;&quot;-&gt;AskPercp]]",
  "AskPrim": "&quot;The Order of the Primrose is the greater faith to which I, and all our Sisters, ultimately serve.  It is... ancient, from the time of the Sharecropping Wars-- the conflict that ultimately broke the majority of the Torean population from AI control.  Freed from our Gods, we sought new perspectives, new faiths.  One of these became our Order, dedicated to the exploration of *Bliss.*\n\n&quot;Pleasure can be easy to find here on Torei, but rarely does that alone bestow contentment.  Thus *Bliss*, a sublime state of physical pleasure, mental contentedness, and societal stability.  It is divinity incarnate, the goal of every Torean soul.  And we assist those seeking Bliss, however can.  Alms, prayer, sanctums for study.  There is no set path to Bliss, but with the proper guidance all roads do lead to it.  Those that do not we know as Sin.&quot;\n\n[[&quot;Sin?  Your Order has a concept of Sin?&quot;-&gt;AskSin]]\n[[&quot;Interesting.  I want to ask about something else.&quot;-&gt;AskCon]]",
  "AskGarden": "&quot;Ah,&quot; she looks up, towards the strange boughs of the nearest tree, and the heavy canopy overhead.  &quot;Of course.  Were you aware that Torei is a new planet, but most galactic standards?  Formed artificially by the AIs, a long time ago by our count, but in a mere blink in the cosmic eye.  These... let us call them trees are from that primordial time.  Have you noticed how they seem to stop... everything?  Wind, sound, *perception.*  We believe they were originally bred by the AI Gods to shield their first agricultural work upon the surface.&quot;\n\nReaching out, Euphoria uses a gloved hand to grab a wave-like branch.  It snaps with only the barest of effort, as if sheared off. &quot;They are brittle, but resilient to weather.  And with such strange properties.  These days only a few copses exist out in the Badlands.  Those who travel such paths call them *Silent Escorts* given how often they are found watching over patches of water.  Here at the Convent, they serve much the same purpose-- escorting us Sisters from the predations of sin.&quot;\n\n[[&quot;Sin?  Your Order has a concept of Sin?&quot;-&gt;AskSin]]\n[[&quot;Interesting.  I want to ask about something else.&quot;-&gt;AskCon]]",
  "AskOrder": "&quot;Our Order is old, but not very large,&quot; the Sister muses, the fullness of her chest made evident as she folds an arm beneath, resting her other on its elbow as she does some quick math with her free hand.\n\n&quot;Perhaps five thousand, across the surface of Torei.  We *do* have a claim to being widespread, at the very least.  Serving at a Convent here, so close to the Way Up, is quite a different experience from a Convent deep in the Antipodes.&quot;\n\n[[&quot;Interesting, I have other question.-&gt;AskCon]]",
  "AskMen": "&quot;Are you asking if we have male members in our Order?&quot; She asks, seeking clarification.  &quot;Or our believes regarding masculinity?&quot;\n\n[[&quot;If you have male members.&quot;-&gt;AskMale]]\n[[&quot;Your overall beliefs, regarding masculinity.&quot;-&gt;AskMasc]]\n[[&quot;Actually... let me think about it, I have other questions.&quot;-&gt;AskCon]]",
  "AskNunSlave": "The collar in question is tight against her throat, thinner along the top and flaring a bit towards the shoulders.  It doesn&#39;t look comfortable.\n\n&quot;You are asking if I am a slave,&quot; she deduces, tilting her head slightly to the side.  Her hood follows, running down her back like glossy hair.  &quot;I am.  All members of the Order are.&quot;\n\nLifting her arms allows the long sleeves to slide down somewhat, revealing cuffs locked onto her wrists.  A second set is visible on her ankles.\n\n&quot;When a prospective Sister joins the Order as a Novitiate, she is enslaved to our Benefactor.  It&#39;s a temporary arrangement at first, but upon one&#39;s Confirmation it is made both lifelong and irreversible.  Thus we commit ourselves wholly to the exploration of Bliss, and the rejection of Sin.  It is the Vow of Service, but just one of many we must take-- others being the Vow of Poverty, the Vow of Femininity, and the Vow of Anonymity.  There are optional ones as well, such as the Vow of Silence, or that of Chastity.&quot;  \n\n[[&quot;Did you mention a &#39;Benefactor&#39;?&quot;-&gt;AskBenny]]\n[[&quot;Interesting.  I want to ask about something else, though.&quot;-&gt;AskCon]]",
  "AskNew": "&quot;The Path to Bliss is always open, for those with the conviction to walk it,&quot; Euphoria replies, blinking slowly.  It&#39;s not hard to imagine she must be quite beautiful beneath that muzzle.  &quot;We offer that program, that of Conversion, here.  But it is a hard path, and most Novitiates drop out when given the opportunity just prior to Confirmation.&quot;\n\nHer lithe shoulders rise and fall, a a serene shrug.  &quot;But if you work through our programs, and if you think you have the resolve, perhaps we could discuss it more later.&quot;\n\n[[Not exactly a glowing endorsement, but a viable path nevertheless?  &quot;I want to ask about something else.&quot;-&gt;AskCon]]",
  "AskPercp": "&quot;Mhm,&quot; the red-eyed woman purrs.  &quot;A good question.  And often debated here, in these very halls.  Perception is much like a triangle, I believe.  Three sided, each component necessary to maintain the whole, but abstract and strange-- mere lines-- without the others.&quot;  \n\nThe Sister mimics drawing a triangle in the space between you, her black gloves so very dark against the red of her cloak sleeve.  &quot;The first side is how we perceive ourselves, both via the sensations we experience, and through our individual acts of judgement.  The second side is how others perceive us, and much akin to the first-- split between that which others observe, and how they react to our choices.  And the third?  That one is more... theoretical.  Difficult to grasp.  It is the sense of perception we have for what our *other* senses have already perceived.  An... esoteric concept, but one I think can be explained with an example.  Imagine you have cut your hand.  The first side is the pain you feel, and how you worry others will react to such a wound.  The second side is the *actual* reaction others have, and how they *think* you feel about the cut.  The third side, then, is how you perceive that sensation of pain, of concern for others.  Are you scared?  Ashamed?  Angry?&quot;\n\nHer gloved hands collect again before her waist.  &quot;Thus... *perception.*&quot;\n\n[[&quot;I see...-&gt;AskCon]]",
  "AskSin": "&quot;We do.&quot;  The Sister looks down at you, momentarily searching your eyes.  Whatever she&#39;s looking for, she doesn&#39;t find it.\n\n&quot;Sin is the antithesis of bliss.  The abolishment of pleasure, dissatisfaction of the mind, or chaos in society.  It is something to avoid, to abhor from afar.  But that is not always possible, and in *those* circumstances corrective action must be taken.&quot;\n\nIt&#39;s a firm line, yet delivered without a break in the Sister&#39;s serene attitude.  &quot;We recognize the Order cannot take sides, however.  Cannot fix the world.  Thus we address only that which we can-- our Sisters.  Those outside of it we merely guide.  The same is applied to the Ringdoms we inhabit, we do not seek to upset their laws or means of governance.&quot;\n\n[[&quot;Hmm, I see.  I want to ask about something else.&quot;-&gt;AskCon]]",
  "AskBenny": "The Nun nods, the thick septum ring piercing her nose shifting slightly.  &quot;Another ancient tradition.  Legal traditions in most Ringdoms hold that for one to be a Slave, there must be a Master.  Our Benefactor would be that Master, although few Sisters ever actually meet him.  He is a Lord in an Antipodal Ringdom, and rarely travels.  We Sisters actually operate the Order, and manage ourselves according to our own Hierarchy.&quot;\n\n[[&quot;Every slave a master, it does make sense, I suppose.  I have other questions.&quot;-&gt;AskCon]]",
  "AskMale": "&quot;We do not,&quot; Euphoria explains matter-of-factly.  &quot;Unlike some religious sects, we are not so traditionalist that we reject the notion of male slavery as a *concept*, but the Order is open only to women.&quot;\n\n\n[[&quot;Your overall beliefs, regarding masculinity then?.&quot;-&gt;AskMasc]]\n[[&quot;Actually... let me think about it, I have other questions.&quot;-&gt;AskCon]]",
  "AskMasc": "&quot;The Order of the Primrose is of Torei, a necessity given our divine task.  Bliss is formed by its surrounding circumstances, after all, making its presence on each planet virtually unique.  Thus our views on gender are somewhat traditionalist, following Torean standards.  We are of the view that, as women, we are by nature subservient.  Beings of sensuality.  Requiring guidance and direction, the sort only a collar can provide.  We are at our best on our knees, submitting to the masculine.&quot;\n\n[[&quot;And, do you have male members?&quot;-&gt;AskMale]]\n[[&quot;The greater galaxy does not hold to those views, at ALL.&quot;-&gt;AskMasc2]]\n[[&quot;Actually... let me think about it, I have other questions.&quot;-&gt;AskCon]]",
  "AskMasc2": "&quot;The Order is quite aware,&quot; the much taller woman replies, unfaltering despite the potential sensitivity of the issue.  &quot;The introduction of the greater galactic community to our planet has not shifted our views on this matter, however.  The Vow of Femininity addresses the subject directly.&quot;\n\n[[&quot;I have other questions.&quot;-&gt;AskCon]]",
  "NunContem2": "&quot;Then follow me.&quot;\n\nCrossing the small clearing in which you had found her, the Sister leads you to where the strange trees ran up against the wall-- revealing a door obscured by a few wayward growths.

  "Lead Walk": "Your destination looms ahead, dark buildings lit by brilliant lights, but the distance to them is quite substantial indeed.  It&#39;s little wonder the Lead system seemed reserved for slaves, and those freewombs incapable of paying for better transport-- somewhere past the first hour mark of your forced march you&#39;re starting to regret going with this particular route.  You&#39;ve been on your feet most of the day after all, and given your outfit that meant doing so in sharp stiletto heels.  Your toes ache and your ankles burn(if: $Brand is true)[, the ballet heels you wear making the effort absolutely grueling].  (if: $Level is &gt; 0)[The hobble chain between your ankles doesn&#39;t help matters either, the restricted gain requiring nearly double the amount of steps you would have naturally taken.]  (if: $Level is &gt; 1)[For once its your armbinder that hardly proves troublesome, your aching arms having gone from acute discomfort to a dull ache somewhere during your actions in town.]\n\n(if: $Slave is true)[Compared to most of the other women utilizing the Lead, however, you do have a distinct disadvantage-- between your legs the dual plugs installed inside your cunt and rear remain, and each step forward shifts them.  The Slave suit kept you wet pretty much regardless, but this particular experience only furthers the effect.  Climax never comes however, the ministrations more then enough to tease you relentlessly, but not enough to cum.]\n\nAt least you have plenty to look at as you march.  The Lead winds its way through the buildings of the outlying district, usually upon a platform raised above street level.  It almost seemed as if you were on display: leashed and dressed in glossy laminate, paraded past the rare individual still on the streets post-curfew.  More are visible within the windowed rooms that look out to the Lead, other offworlders given the perfect opportunity to gaze out upon your sort-- locked into a high tech slave coffle.\n\n[[Your march continues.-&gt;Lead Walk2]]\n\n",
  "Train Ride": "Diving down beneath the cityscape, the train reemerges on the far side, apparently running at ground level for the distance between the city center and the outskirts you had just left.  The ride itself takes only fifteen minutes, but you cover a considerable distance.  Had you taken the Lead, you imagine you may have been walking for *hours.*  With your heels, clearly a considerable discomfort had just been avoided.  And in that warm feeling of choices well made, you consider the next one before you: the Club and the Way Up.\n\nThe Black Card had given an address, 356 Cross Street, and a time-- dusk.  Both rapidly approached.  Despite all your misadventures along the way, you could still make it.  The deal of a lifetime with a party unknown could still go down.  *If* that was what you still wanted.\n\nA safer option presented itself, of course.  The ticket you held for the Way Up.  It expired at midnight tonight, and to chase the Black Card&#39;s promise would be to risk missing your ride.  And that was ignoring your battered memory, the mystery that still held sway there.  Could you have erased your own recollection of recent events, and tied yourself to that bed, in some attempt to prevent a meeting with that Black Card?  Why?\n\nEither way, a decision would have to be made soon.  Glancing out the window again, you are greeted with another transit hub, much like the one you left in that it had been built on a raised platform.  But this one is towered over by the buildings around it, and on approach you can already see the platform is much busier then the outskirts.  \n\n[[Next stop: Grand Aekora!-&gt;Train Ride 2]]",
  "Carriage Ride": "Your trip is made in comfort, and glancing out the window, a fair bit of style too.  The carriage was not particularly fast, but the quartet of harnessed girls providing your transport draw eyes which soon fall upon *you.*  You had witnessed how rare vehicles tended to be, after all.  It&#39;s not hard to consider the curiosity that filled those you passed, wondering who had the wealth to travel in style.  It&#39;s a tantalizing prospect, but one you eventually push aside.\n\nThe ride itself takes only an hour, but you cover a considerable distance.

  "Slave Train": "Flashes of neon blur the train&#39;s windows, but from your kneeling position upon the floor you can make out little of the passing scenery.  Instead of immediately continuing however, Isabella takes a moment to pull her electronic cigarette from her purse.  The tip glows a familiar red as she gets it going, allowing you a moment&#39;s rest.\n\n[[Ensure your posture is perfect, stick our chest out just a bit further.-&gt;SlaveTChest]]\n[[Glance about the train car, keeping your eyes down.-&gt;SlaveTGlance]]",
  "NunLead2": "&lt;img alt=&quot;lead&quot; src=&quot;images/reg/lead.jpg&quot;/&gt;\n\nThe Lead platform is little more then a concrete patch beneath a suspended wire line, from which descend a length of steel cable every few feet.  As you watch, those freewombs or slaves capable of hooking their collars to the cables do so-- those too heavily bound are assisted in the effort by attendants.  After a few moments, the Lead moves of its own accord, &#39;escorting&#39; its charge forward-- along a raised corridor that disappears between the distant buildings. \n\nThe attendant brings you to a segregated loading position, red marks on the floor spelling out FULL RESTRAINT.  Unhooking your leash, Euphoria returns it to her belt as she leans in.\n\n&quot;As I said, we will be taking the Lead into town, Sister Azalea.  We are slaves, after all, and are not allowed other options.  It is traditional within our convent that we do so utilizing Aekora&#39;s full restraint package, to which you will be fitted shortly.  I would recommend you take the opportunity for self-reflection this trip will provide.  Now pull down your muzzle, and open your mouth.&quot;\n\n[[&quot;Do we need... whatever this is, though?&quot;-&gt;NunLead3No]]\n[[&quot;Yes, Sister.&quot;-&gt;NunLeadYes]]",
  "NunLead3No": "Euphoria&#39;s red eyes loom out from beneath the shadow of her habit, catching you in their stern gaze.  &quot;You are new to the Order, and I will remember that-- this time.  But know that if you speak out of turn again, I will perform corrective action upon you.  Women are best seen, not heard, and are we Sisters not that femininity exemplified?&quot;\n\nShe doesn&#39;t give you an opportunity to protest, but instead makes her demand again.  &quot;Pull your muzzle down, and open your mouth.&quot;\n\nYou&#39;re in too deep now to truly resist.\n\n[[&quot;Yes, Sister.&quot;-&gt;NunLeadYes]]",
  "NunLeadYes": "Reaching up, your gloved hands momentarily shift the ring piercing your septum as you seize the laminate muzzle below it.  Pulling the thin material down reveals your lips, and while you cannot bear witness yourself, you have seen already upon Euphoria what had been done there-- a paired set of words are carefully written, one one each lip in bright white.  **Sinner.  Slave.**  You cannot speak to another without their being so reminded.\n\nBut you&#39;re not asked to speak here.  Instead Sister Euphoria provides you with a black rubber ball, seating it behind your teeth before securing the strap behind your head.  The gag is then covered by your muzzle again, a slight bump the only hint that you had been denied speech.\n\nThen its the attendant&#39;s turn, opening her briefcase to reveal the implements of *full restraint.*  Your arms are positioned behind your back then linked together with a small clip that utilizes your cuffs.  A chain is then run up, forcing your hands up in a terribly unnatural way, until it can be connected to the waiting d-ring at the back of your collar.  The result is a position of reverse prayer, an aching pain already rising in your forearms.  Your ankles are given a similar, if less restrictive treatment, the cuffs there being linked together with a short bit of chain.  You could still walk, if only barely.\n\n&quot;Ah, a familiar experience,&quot; Euphoria muses quietly, watching as the final implement is affixed to you: a blindfold of black laminate, returning you to a darkness much like that of the Convent.  \n\n[[&quot;What now?&quot;-&gt;NunLead3]]",
  "NunLead3": "&quot;Mmmmgh.&quot;  It&#39;s all you can manage, the ball gag very much doing its work.  Your moan seems to have drawn Euphoria however, who gently runs her hand along your habit as if it were hair.  Her tone is soothing.  &quot;Hush.  You need only focus on your walking.  Without eyes to see, and hobbled as you are it will be difficult.&quot;\n\nThe sound of further metallic rustling announces the Lead&#39;s chain running to the system above being snapped to your collar, just before you feel its weight.  Euphoria&#39;s doing, provided with a final bit of advice.\n\n&quot;Let your leash guide you, and remember: I&#39;ll be right behind you.&quot;\n\nThat explains the wait that follows, the sounds of Euphoria being similarly restrained drifting back to you.  Eventually the attendant inquires if anything further was required, to which the Elder Sister responds with a gagged moan of her own.  That would be a no, presumably.\n\nYou don&#39;t have to wait much longer before the Lead kicks suddenly into motion, pulling you forward.  Stepping, your hobble chain almost immediately goes taut.  The Lead hardly cares, requiring a great deal of effort as you struggle to take your next step.  Blindfolded, it takes you a longer moment to notice the curving of your leash, the Lead moving to join into a singular track, merging with its fellows as it entered the city proper.\n\nAlready you&#39;re panting.\n\n[[It&#39;s going to be a long walk.-&gt;NunLead4]]",
  "NunLead4": "It&#39;s little wonder the Lead system seemed reserved for slaves, and those freewombs incapable of paying for better transport-- somewhere past the first hour mark of your forced march you&#39;re feeling the effects of your fresh uniform.  You&#39;ve been on your feet most of the day after all, and given your outfits thus far that meant doing so in sharp stiletto heels.  Your toes ache and your ankles burn, joining the sharp pain that comes from your strictly pinned arms.  Meanwhile the gag between your lips and the muzzle atop it effectively deny breathing through through the mouth, requiring your pierced nose to perform the heavy labor all the while fighting the strict embrace of your corset to pull in oxygen.\n\nYou cannot help but struggle somewhat, moaning lewdly into your gag as you shift your shoulders.  All that does is wiggle your breasts, the piercings embedded in each nipple making themselves known as the soft flesh shifts.  Had you more control over yourself perhaps you would have considered the way the raised walkway seemed designed to put you on display, the Lead being little more then a high tech slave coffle, your humiliation and submission so clearly demonstrated for any passerby.\n\n[[&quot;Mmmmh...&quot;-&gt;NunLead5]]\n[[Push your chest out.-&gt;NunLead5]]\n[[Try to pull against the Lead.-&gt;NunLead5]]\n",
  "Lead Walk2": "Another hour passes, and then another.

Had you been fitted with a gag like Devi had been wearing, you could have been stationed in a corner with a tray of drinks and been little more than a decoration.  \n\nYou may have started this day bound to a bed, but somehow you&#39;ve found yourself in an even more compromised situation.](if: $Pun is true)[The other clubgoers were dressed for a night out on the proverbial town, but your reflection in the mirror suggests so much *more*.

You didn&#39;t even look human anymore, except in the vaguest of terms, but more akin to a... toy, or doll.  Something to be played with, teased, tortured-- and then put away when not in use.

Turning to regard her, you see that she is uniformed-- in tight laminate.  Surrounded by the violet hues of the club, her servant&#39;s livery matches nicely in it&#39;s light shade of blue, being tight across her chest before expanding to a very short skirt.  Just how short it is she demonstrates by lifting it for you while bowing.  (if: $PlayE is true)[You recognize it from your time with Isabella as a very well practiced Torean reverence.](else: )[A Torean curtsy of some sort, you reckon.]\n\n&quot;I saw you observing yourself in the mirror,&quot; she explains, smoothing out her skirt and petticoats, &quot;and I just had to say it, (if: $Slave is true or $Pun is true or $Maid is true)[slave to slave.](else: )[Mistress].

Let me run you through the various services we offer here, alright?&quot;\n\nShe steps more directly to your side, allowing her white gloved hand to be more easily followed as she uses it to direct your gaze.  &quot;Most of our guests start at the bar, which is fully stocked with a range of drinks-- both alcoholic and otherwise-- sourced from all over Torei, as well as a selection imported from the Offworlders.  Or if you like, you may take a seat at a table or booth.  Built into each is a button you can use to call the nearest available slave at your convenience, as well as to reward or punish us as you deem necessary.&quot;\n\nJust what *that* meant isn&#39;t clear, as Cherish turns you towards the mouth of a hallway that disappears into darkness-- a bright pink neon sign above shaped like a pillow.  &quot;We also provide several private rooms, outfitted with lounging areas and bed, rented by the hour.  Many freewombs utilize them to solicit their betters, but for the right price you can also rent me-- or any of the other slaves in-uniform for the night, if you like.&quot;  Another wink.  &quot;(if: $Pun is true)[Well, *you* specifically can&#39;t do that, given your suit and status.](else: )[Restraints included, of course.]&quot;\n\nFinally she casts her attention upward, to the second story balcony overlooking the stage.  &quot;And that would be our VIP area.

I just need to stop at the bar, I will be right back.&quot;\n\nTaking your card, Cherish moves just as indicated, allowing you to watch her go.

At her return, however, you sense an incoming problem.\n\n&quot;(if: $Status is 2)[Mistress](else: )[Well],&quot; she begins, &quot;the good news is that we did have your name on record.

Perhaps your expression (if: $Slave is true)[despite your mask](if: $Pun is true)[,or more accurately your body language,] gives that away, as Cherish speaks up again.\n\n&quot;Alternatively...&quot; she adjusts her glasses, Torean biomedical prowess meaning they *had* to just be for decoration.  &quot;...you could perhaps seek authorization from one of our VIP members still down here, in the common area?&quot;\n\nShe first indicates a woman seated primly at one of the private booths.

She is a scholar, as I understand it, but more importantly to your purposes a member of House Sargon-- one of the two ruling families of Aekora, and a VIP member.

I am not certain if that is his first name, or last... he is *quite* mysterious.  But he is a VIP member as well.&quot;\n\n[[&quot;Only the two options?

  "DaeWhere": "&quot;That question&#39;s answer is as old as human settlement on Torei.  Did you know this planet isn&#39;t... *natural?*  It was constructed, from stellar dust and debris, by the polar AIs.  Mazos and Dahome, as we call them.  They built this planet over passing aeons, then cultivated its atmosphere-- and finally set to work on populating it.  Thus the first humans were bred, but when they proved unruly... the Isolation Laminates.  Leave it to an artificial intelligence to take such an efficient approach, converting dissidents into slave-overseers.&quot;\n\nTysus flicks open an annotated timeline upon her holographic display, its sheer length demonstrating Torei&#39;s great age.  &quot;We broke free, of course.

But the AIs still have their slaves, deep within their polar ziggurats-- and the occasional unfortunate in an Isolation Laminate still walks among us.

They do no think as we do, they do not have personalities to interact with, we are not even sure if their consciousness is gestalt, unified, or some other obscure form of sentience.  Think... think of the Daemons as a thousand fingers emerging from a terrifying hand, so vast as to be almost infinite.  We cannot hope to perceive what such a hand would intend to grasp.&quot;\n\n[[&quot;Where do they come from?&quot;-&gt;DaeWhere]]\n[[&quot;So are the humans within aware?&quot;-&gt;DaeAware]]\n[[&quot;Why use humans at all?&quot;-&gt;DaeWhyHuman]]\n[[&quot;That&#39;s enough on what they are, for now.&quot;-&gt;SargonDae]]",
  "DaeAware": "&quot;I sincerely hope not,&quot; Tysus replies, lips drawing into a tight line.  &quot;Evidence however... suggests we cannot jump to conclusions, either way.  Leading theories suggest the prisoner, if we may use that term, is perhaps in a perpetual fugue state.  Slipping into and out of perception of the world beyond their Isolation Laminate.  Daemons have been observed working through pleasure cycles, however-- a clear indicator of the human within being stimulated.&quot;\n\n[[&quot;Where do they come from?&quot;-&gt;DaeWhere]]\n[[&quot;What do they want?&quot;-&gt;DaeWhat]]\n[[&quot;Why use humans at all?&quot;-&gt;DaeWhyHuman]]\n[[&quot;That&#39;s enough on what they are, for now.&quot;-&gt;SargonDae]]",
  "DaeWhyHuman": "&quot;Another good question,&quot; the professorial Mistress replies, tapping her fingers upon the table.  &quot;The initial reason for their creation makes sense-- converting dissidents among the AI&#39;s slave populations into easily managed testaments to their will.  But why persist in this program, after so many centuries?  I do have a theory, though.&quot;\n\nShe leans in.  &quot;They persist because we allow it.

Eyes and ears for the AIs, nudging the events in their grand machinations.&quot;\n\n[[&quot;Where do they come from?&quot;-&gt;DaeWhere]]\n[[&quot;What do they want?&quot;-&gt;DaeWhat]]\n[[&quot;So are the humans within aware?&quot;-&gt;DaeAware]]\n[[&quot;That&#39;s enough on what they are, for now.&quot;-&gt;SargonDae]]",
  "DaeEnclose": "&quot;Yes.  Fully.  Of that we are certain.  From helmet to heels, which yes-- both genders wear.  The material itself is laminate, much like you or I bear, but the AIs have ensured only the Daemons have access to what is clearly a more advanced composition.  Details vary, and as always firsthand reports are rare, but shape-shifting of a limited variety as well as complete vacuum protection have been reported.  That they persist on internal air recycling has been demonstrated rather simply, by a lack of observed condensation from breathing in colder environments.&quot;\n\nTysus pauses.  &quot;What the suit inflicts upon its wearer in such a closed environment is not altogether clear, however.

  "DaeDefense": "&quot;Hardly!  There is a reason there has never been a confirmed capture of a Daemon for more then a few hours.

Their suits can shift in shape to a limited degree as well, forming blades or most anything else they need.  And *that* is all on top of their strength.

Given their abilities, the apparent semi-direct control exerted over them-- they must require constant power infusions, right?  Well you would be wrong.

But this is one of the subjects in which we *do* understand how they do it.  Are you familiar with piezoelectricty?&quot;\n\nShe doesn&#39;t wait for you to actually reply, continuing instead.  &quot;Certain materials can generate electricity in response to mechanical stress... such as the metallic boning of a corset.  Yes it enforces the intended waistline, but with every breath the wearer stresses the material-- and we have nigh-infinite energy.&quot;\n\nThe Mistress actually smiles for once.  &quot;Even the male Daemons are corseted, if you&#39;re wondering.

The prisoners are dressed in varying manners, undoubtedly because they were picked up somewhere else tonight by the Officers sweeping the Clubs, but their situation is universal.  Each is locked into an individual cage, laying on her back with legs folded but spread.  Some are gagged and most are moaning, but the sound of vibrators at work is universal.

You&#39;re not sure how, but given a few borrowed hours of freedom perhaps you could still save yourself... you&#39;re already so close to the Way Up, after all.*\n\n&quot;So, what will it be?&quot;  Officer Nikaido asks, crossing her arms beneath her chest.  &quot;Stay under arrest and go onto the punishment frame, or a few hours parole?&quot;\n\n[[&quot;I&#39;m not helping enslave anyone else.

Demonstrate you can do more then that, bring me a truant for example, and I&#39;ll even offer you conscription into the Ministry.  You&#39;ll have until the end of my shift-- midnight.&quot;\n\nThat doesn&#39;t give you much time, but you hardly expect pity from the Officer at this point.  Stepping forward she does offer a hand to help you from the cage however, although when you go to take it she seizes your wrist instead.\n\n&quot;There is one more thing, before you go.  Know that if you fail me, or if you try to take this opportunity to run, I *will* find you.  And to make sure you don&#39;t get into any trouble...&quot;\n\nShe snaps her free hand, a prompt that brings one of her subordinate Officer over-- a fearsome looking device tipped with a needle being given over.\n\n[[&quot;What&#39;s that for...?&quot;-&gt;ArrestEnd5]]\n[[Uh oh...-&gt;ArrestEnd5]]",

Cutting away your previous garments, they replace them with stark black laminate, an exact match for the tortured rows of other women all around you.  Catsuit and corset, heels and gloves, cuffs and armbinder.  They&#39;re added to your body one by one, stripping you of freedoms as simple as the right to use your own hands-- until the final piece is held before you.  The mask.  Rendered in heavy, thick laminate, you cannot help but think of a similar mask, offered so recently by the Daemon.  But this one you cannot turn down.\n\nOnce masked, the only thing left is to rig you to the punishment frame.  Without eyes to see or a mouth to scream, you&#39;re forced into a strict position bent over, your restrained arms held up and above you in a strappado position that quickly proves uncomfortable.  There you are rigged, locked to the frame, but not yet done-- the final instrument of your punishment comes in the form of your dildos, still installed, roaring to life.\n\n&quot;How long for this one?&quot; You can just barely hear the Officer nearest you ask of Nikaido.

  "SSRemoval": "You&#39;re seized as soon as you enter, the door snapping shut behind.  Much like the hotel&#39;s Wardrobe, this one has a drain in the bottom of the unit, its use revealed by the first stage of your re-dressing-- the removal.  Instead of peeling the laminate from your body, a simple solvent is applied by a spraying arm, and in mere moments the material is dripping off your body like so much wet paint.  \n\nRemoving your plugs is a different matter-- that requires a pair of arms to seize them directly, but as you squirm in your restraints they&#39;re pulled free from your tortured cunt.  You take a deep breath, the first in some time, as you are no longer masked.  A brief, tantalizing taste of nudity follows... but not for long.  With a fresh whirl, the Wardrobe begins working on your new outfit as a ring descends from above.\n\nThus your outfit is quiet literally printed on, first applying bright white but transitioning to an equally vibrant shade of red as it passes your waist and forms a stylish pencil skirt.  The ring descending bit by bit, rendering soft flesh into equally soft but so very *different* laminate.  Secondary arms follow it down, providing spot treatment along seams and friction points-- although often the effect is for merely aesthetic purposes.  Sometimes that takes the form of a second application of laminate, other times it lingers to produce something more substantial-- such as the small folded collar just beneath your chin, or the buttons that almost immediately strain to keep your bust constrained by your bodice.\n\nYou&#39;re given no time to rest as the base layer concludes, the ring rapidly ascending as other arms move into the space to begin work on your accessories.  The peplum skirt you saw pictured is thus formed, starting with the belt at your waist.  Small pre-forged rivets are sunk into the still molten laminate before it is sealed, as is the belt loop that is seated directly over your naval.  Still held in place, small arms flair the laminate that extends over your rear, achieving the look most of the galaxy would label as *slutty* but Torei saw as merely coquettish.\n\nThe final component of your outfit comes with the sensation of your own feet rising, the sensation unequal and focused primarily at your heel.  Without the restraint arms you would have toppled over, but they hold you tight, tall heels being extruded into place.  More red laminate follows, coating your feet excepting the stylish hole at the very front.\n\nAlmost as an afterthought, makeup is applied last.  Mechanical arms seize your head, holding it tight as nozzles approach your face.  A quick blast of air instinctively causes your eyes to close, and in that brief moment the Wardrobe does its work.  Your eyelids have been darkened, a crimson secondary coat added that flashed only when light slid across it.  Pores and blemishes have been rendered impotent as well, while your cheekbones have been highlighted.  And your lips are now a poignant, inviting red.\n(set: $Plugs to false)(set: $Slave to false)(set: $Sec to true)(set: $debt to it - 250)\nThen, with a final flash of white light and a conclusive hiss, the armatures withdraw.\n\n[[You emerge...-&gt;SSRemoval2]]",

At your feet ballet heels are extruded and then connected to knee high boots, while at your waist an under-bust corset is installed, then tightened cruelly by the Wardrobe itself.  \n\nAfterward your arms are pulled back and layers of laminate applied upon them, linking them together in a single-sleeve armbinder that both prevents any usage of your arms *and* proves decidedly uncomfortable in mere moments.  Progressing further up a posture collar, also in black, is printed for around your throat.  With it in place, running firmly from jaw to collarbone, you cannot turn your head nor look down.  Makeup follows, violet lipstick being applied to your lips, eyeliner and blush accompanying-- while large fake eyelashes ensure a permanently sultry look.\n\nThe final component is a gag, a large black ball being seated behind your teeth as straps are printed to hold it firmly in place by snapping into place behind your head.

Instead your laminate is simply cut off, the sensation of sharp shears running so near your skin quite disconcerting.  Yet it achieves its goal without cutting you, leaving you momentarily stripped to your bare skin.\n\nAbove you the halo-like device that mounted the printing armatures descends, and your new gear is built in place upon you.  It starts with a Torean classic, the catsuit, this one covering your head but leaving holes at eyes, nose, and mouth-- and being utterly transparent.  Atop it a second layer, this one white, is added to your head and torso.  At your hips it runs down between your legs, adding a second zipper over your womanhood, but the cut is flared so as to expose more of your hips.  Then your arms are forced to cross beneath your chest, heavy laminate bands securing them there-- and forming a straitjacket that would make you utterly helpless.  \n\nAccessories follow in the form of black ballet boots, ensuring you could hardly walk much less run, a hobble chain between your ankles as if to further that proposition, and a thick black collar at your throat.  Only as an afterthought does it seem to add a pair of laminate pieces to your dual-layered hood, one sliding a laminate ring behind your teeth, forcing your mouth into an &#39;O&#39;, before covering your lips, the second clearly intended to serve as a blindfold-- although this hangs loosely to the side of your head for the time being.\n\nMost of the arms retreat afterward, but one remains to stencil a final pair of labels upon your straitjacket: above your left breast the cryptic **#R55**, and on your back in especially bold letters: \n\n**Slave Detainee**\n**Ministry of Truants**\n(set: $Gear to 26)(set: $Inv to (a:))\n(colour: Green)[Inventory Cleared!]\n\n[[And with that, you are released...-&gt;SmugSpecial7]]",

A wall they cannot cross, not without *considerable* risk.&quot;\n\nShe smiles.  &quot;Celeste Academy is the alternative.  If the chances are high that you&#39;re about to be collared, you&#39;re already destined to enroll with us-- Celeste Academy holds an exclusive contract with the local branch of the Ministry of Truants.  Convicted prisoners stripped of their freewomb status are given over to us for training, or retraining, as necessary.  But *how* one gets enrolled is important.  Come to us willingly, enroll *yourself*, and you can achieve a better valuation and thus placement during your time with us.  Often that leads to a more comfortable sort of service upon graduation, and auction.&quot;\n\n(if: $Servant is true or $Slave is true)[You get the sense she would have greeted you more formally in that moment, had you not been dressed as you are, but she still nods your way.](else: )[She stands, bowing lightly in your direction.]  &quot;My name is Veronica.

Inexpensive slaves, who often come to us from the Ministry of Truants, often end up serving in very... menial roles.

Having your current slavery invalidated should be simple enough, as long as you&#39;re enrolling with us-- the Courts would be more concerned that you remain in slavery, not the particular terms of it.&quot;\n\n[[Well that is... good news?-&gt;CustomAcademy]]",
  "AcadSlave": "&quot;Your ID, again?&quot;  Pulling up your records, Veronica pages through them slowly.  &quot;Hmm... no.  Voluntary submission to a slave suit is rare, but it would not harm an attempt to enroll with us.  In fact, it demonstrates a clear indication of submissive tendencies.  That would in fact serve you quite well-- as a fully collared slave you would of course be under constant restrictions, and expectations would be that you respect your betters.&quot;\n\nVeronica adjusts her posture slightly.  &quot;As a slave, that is most everyone else.&quot;\n\n[[&quot;I have other questions.&quot;-&gt;CustomAcademy]]",

Signing away one&#39;s liberty was a simple enough thing, on Torei.\n\nOffering it to you, she then pulls forth a simple circle of silver, unadorned but clearly featuring a heavy lock on the back.  A collar.  *Your* collar.

But the catch is that Torei is too isolated for that.  Their credit network here is isolated, you have to exchange your chit for a Torean one upon arrival.

In this secondary circumstance, the ownership rights upon your person would be stripped from you, and you would be given training until such time as you can be auctioned by this Ringdom.

These appear to have formed something like a box or two once upon a time, but ripped apart and exposed to the elements its mostly just trash now, utterly useless.\n\nBut as you pull away the battered laminate you find something *else*.

Had you been without it you doubt anyone could make out where they were going, a fact that dawns on you just as you hit a dead-end-- an ancient tunnel collapse sealing the path forward.

She had paid for it with an eventual cage beside you that evening, but obviously your paths had diverged-- she was still free, and you... had become part of the system that would certainly send her to a collar for another infraction.  That fact and your identity she is clearly aware of as well, as she speaks.\n\n&quot;Oh my, it&#39;s you!  Please!  They will send me to auction if I&#39;m arrested again!

One needs only walk down the street to recognize the most immediate peculiarity of the Torean people, and that is the predominance of women.  Official population counts put the male to female ration at 1-to-10, a rate achieved largely to their natural physiology.*\n\n*Torean men are Haploid, while Torean women are Diploid.  As we do not expect the average reader to have focused all that much in biology class, in short this means that sexual intercourse between men and women always produce a female child.  In turn, if a women goes without fertilization in this manner, she will eventually give birth to a male child (over a far longer period of time, and if birth control is not utilized, which gets into biomedical topics that could fill a thousand other entries).  This also means that Torean men do not have fathers, and are instead inheriting genetically from their mother’s fathers (thus their grandfathers.)*\n\n*Confused yet?  Bumblebees (which incidentally like most insects are not found on Torei) reproduce in a similar manner, and that hive-like structure may best explain WHY this occurs.  For that, one must look to the progenitors of Torean civilization, their eternal polar AIs…*\n\n[[Return to the index.-&gt;Hotel Glass]]",
  "GlassTrans": "**Rewriting Gender, the Torean Way **\n\n*The planet Torei is renowned for its biomedical capabilities, but of more interest for many is how that intersects with cultural tendencies towards gender.  It is true that men are generally seen more favorably planetside, if only because they are rarer, and thus more predisposed towards wealth.  One would perhaps think that imbalance leads to strict limitations on gender, but the truth is far different indeed.*\n\n*Transitioning between genders is relatively easy (if expensive) on Torei, for offworlders one needs only reach the planet and book an appointment (or several, depending on the breadth of said transition) with the Ministry of Improvements.  Male-to-female changes are straightforward, capable of even achieving reproductive capability if Torean physiology is adopted, but prospective patients should be wary: Torean laws apply far differently towards women, and registration with the Ministry of Wombs should not be taken lightly.  Few Toreans utilize this procedure however, as male slaves are far more valuable, and free males rarely wish to relinquish any bit of their power.  Female-to-male changes are similar in cost, but the with added economic consideration that any additional value earned from joining the relatively rare ranks of men on the planet is generally offset by the cost of the procedure in the first place.*\n\n[[Return to the index.-&gt;Hotel Glass]]",
  "GlassRing": "**Ringdoms, Neither Ring-Shaped nor Kingdoms (Usually?)**\n\n*Comparable to nation-states, Ringdoms are the foundational political unit that dominate the largely habitable ring around equatorial Torei.  Despite the name they do indeed come in all manner of shapes and sizes, along with an equally myriad variation in government types.  Kingdoms, republics, theocracies, and commonwealths, as well as everything in between run from what’s called the “Mountainous” region surrounding the singular Space Elevator, and the Antipodes, the region on the far side of the planet.\n\nTalking in generalities about Ringdoms is always dangerous, but one can at least say that those nearest the space elevator are the most familiar in manner to offworlders and travelers.  Galactic-level amenities are common, representation with offworld trade groups can provide some manner of diplomatic protection, and local governments are generally progressive (at least by Torean standards).  In turn, the Antipodes are often fiercely traditional, with technological adoption varying widely.  \n\nThe Ringdom of Aekora, in which you now stand, is in the Mountainous region, but does not abut the space elevator directly.  It is a Diarchy, ruled by a pair of Diarchs elected to the positions.  While technically open to any Torean-born Aekoran citizen, in practice these positions have split between the richest two families in the Ringdom—the Naram-Sin, and the Sargon.*\n\n[[Return to the index.-&gt;Hotel Glass]]",

  "GlassRepro2": "**Torean Reproduction, or: where are all the men?!**\n\n*We may have as yet failed to find other sentient life in the abyssal reaches of space, but variations do exist among us humans, and the planet Torei’s particular history is no exception.  One needs only walk down the street to recognize the most immediate peculiarity of the Torean people, and that is the predominance of women.  Official population counts put the male to female ration at 1-to-10, a rate achieved largely to their natural physiology.*\n\n*Torean men are Haploid, while Torean women are Diploid.  As we do not expect the average reader to have focused all that much in biology class, in short this means that sexual intercourse between men and women always produce a female child.  In turn, if a women goes without fertilization in this manner, she will eventually give birth to a female child (over a far longer period of time, and if birth control is not utilized, which gets into biomedical topics that could fill a thousand other entries).  This also means that Torean men do not have fathers, and are instead inheriting genetically from their mother’s fathers (thus their grandfathers.)*\n\n*Confused yet?  Bumblebees (which incidentally like most insects are not found on Torei) reproduce in a similar manner, and that hive-like structure may best explain WHY this occurs.  For that, one must look to the progenitors of Torean civilization, their eternal polar AIs…*\n\n[[Return to the index.-&gt;Guide]]",
  "GlassTrans2": "**Rewriting Gender, the Torean Way **\n\n*The planet Torei is renowned for its biomedical capabilities, but of more interest for many is how that intersects with cultural tendencies towards gender.  It is true that men are generally seen more favorably planetside, if only because they are rarer, and thus more predisposed towards wealth.  One would perhaps think that imbalance leads to strict limitations on gender, but the truth is far different indeed.*\n\n*Transitioning between genders is relatively easy (if expensive) on Torei, for offworlders one needs only reach the planet and book an appointment (or several, depending on the breadth of said transition) with the Ministry of Improvements.  Male-to-female changes are straightforward, capable of even achieving reproductive capability if Torean physiology is adopted, but prospective patients should be wary: Torean laws apply far differently towards women, and registration with the Ministry of Wombs should not be taken lightly.  Few Toreans utilize this procedure however, as male slaves are far more valuable, and free males rarely wish to relinquish any bit of their power.  Female-to-male changes are similar in cost, but the with added economic consideration that any additional value earned from joining the relatively rare ranks of men on the planet is generally offset by the cost of the procedure in the first place.*\n\n[[Return to the index.-&gt;Guide]]",
  "GlassRing2": "**Ringdoms, Neither Ring-Shaped nor Kingdoms (Usually?)**\n\n*Comparable to nation-states, Ringdoms are the foundational political unit that dominate the largely habitable ring around equatorial Torei.  Despite the name they do indeed come in all manner of shapes and sizes, along with an equally myriad variation in government types.  Kingdoms, republics, theocracies, and commonwealths, as well as everything in between run from what’s called the “Mountainous” region surrounding the singular Space Elevator, and the Antipodes, the region on the far side of the planet.\n\nTalking in generalities about Ringdoms is always dangerous, but one can at least say that those nearest the space elevator are the most familiar in manner to offworlders and travelers.  Galactic-level amenities are common, representation with offworld trade groups can provide some manner of diplomatic protection, and local governments are generally progressive (at least by Torean standards).  In turn, the Antipodes are often fiercely traditional, with technological adoption varying widely.  \n\nThe Ringdom of Aekora, in which you now stand, is in the Mountainous region, but does not abut the space elevator directly.  It is a Diarchy, ruled by a pair of Diarchs elected to the positions.  While technically open to any Torean-born Aekoran citizen, in practice these positions have split between the richest two families in the Ringdom—the Naram-Sin, and the Sargon.*\n\n[[Return to the index.-&gt;Guide]]",
  "Milky": "Long long ago, back when humanity had only begun to spread out of its spiral arm of its home galaxy, an empire had ambitions. This empire, known only to history as “The Laminate Culture” or “The Lamination People” because of the style of clothing they produced, saw the end of expansion within the Milky Way before most of the rest of us had. Due to coincidences in the angular momentum of outer-spiral stars, they were hedged in by strong nations they had a tense yet stable peace with. They needed someplace to grow, but didn’t dare move in on any of the stars in their neighborhood.\n\nAnd so an ingenious yet barmy plan was hatched to send colonists to the Andromeda galaxy. The plan was to settle those stars with Laminate Culture colonies early, and spread outward through that galaxy before anyone else had managed to start an expedition. To their credit, they thought long-term: the journey would take a thousand years, and they’d have no way of ferrying wealth from these new stars to the mother world. This was a very very long game, and it took a special kind of desperation to even want to play it.\n\nYou can’t send a live crew on a thousand-year journey that never comes close to any stars. A generation-ship would need more fuel for life support on such a journey than it would for deceleration. The fleet they designed was effectively a big dumb intergalactic comet: machinery and gene banks and artificial intelligences wrapped in a giant geode of protective minerals and ice. Everything would just sit off and safe and inert until it came near the energy of a star again.\n\n[[Return to the index.-&gt;Guide]]",
  "OffCourse": "Of course, as you can all guess now, this little spore never made it to Andromeda. Stories differ on what happened to it. Some say that the geode craft had some sort of purely analog course-correcting device that locked onto a stray stellar cluster in intergalactic space. Others say that something went wrong, and emergency systems woke to active mode and changed the ship’s course. The more fanciful tales tell of signals sent from the Milky Way to sabotage the project by changing the objectives.\n\nWhatever the reason, the ship took a rendezvous course that brought it to a stable orbit around the most suitable of a handful of lonely stars stuck like an island out in the nowhere between the galaxies. The light of this star melted the geode and woke up the machines, who began building factories and supply lines to construct a suitable habitat for the colony.\n\nAs I’ve mentioned before, the amount of planning that went into this project is breathtaking. The original implementors hadn’t considered their payload would get mired in this backwater, but they’d designed the construction phase to bootstrap itself even in harsh conditions. Simple machines built factories that spat out more complicated machines that built more factories to make even better machines. This process continued until at least three of the AIs in the fleet had been augmented enough to begin the next phase.\n\n[[Return to the index.-&gt;Guide]]",
  "BuildHab": "Once the brains were awake, it was time to build a home for organic life. None of the planets in the cluster were likely globes, so the machines took a rocky ball on the edge of the Goldilocks zone and launched all the chunks of ice and carbonaceous chondrite they could find. If you think the timescale for the original mission was long, well the AIs had near-infinite patience. Piece by piece over tens of thousands of years, they built up a planet from dry stone into something that could support life.\n\nMachines around the various stars in the cluster lensed starlight to knock matter out of stable orbits and off toward the new planet. I’ve been on expedition, and seen the lens devices with my own eyes. They’re impressive machines, like vast engines of war from our distant and more violent past. I’m told they still work, if the AIs ever want to use them again.\n\nThe planet’s new crust slowly cooled around the freshly molten core, and this is where the Torei we know today began. The machines set down at the two poles and dug intricate tunnels through to the hot mantle beneath, making impossibly complicated fractal corkscrew patterns. Through Coriolis forces, heat, pressure and other simple physics the magma was separated out into component elements useful for generating an atmosphere.\n\nThe machines built tetrahedral “caps” of sorts atop the vents from these tunnels, and did all of the final distillation and synthesis in them. These pyramids are apparently still there inside the current-day ziggurats. The real machinery for atmospheric generation descends down into the network of tunnels, but there is a hollow space inside the zigs where the caps can be seen.\n\nAh, I suppose you all have the famous image of the Dahom ziggurat in the snow. Well imagine that landscape with no snow yet, because the air was too dry. Now imagine that the vast stepped pyramid is only one-twentieth the size, and smooth-sided. That’s how they got started. Those little pyramids worked tirelessly for centuries to generate an atmosphere suitable for garden crops and large mammals.\n\nThe ziggurats at Mazos and Dahom were built later, and we have hints that they were an act of desperation. We think that the AIs realized that they weren’t making enough progress on a self-sustaining biosphere. They created the zigs as habitat domes with the hopes that human workers could help speed up the project.\n\n[[Return to the index.-&gt;Guide]]",
  "FirstHumans": "If that was the plan, then it worked. The first humans probably awoke inside the bottom level of one of the zigs, before they built the upper layers. They’d have had hydroponic gardens already running to give them fresh food and filtered water. There would have been some livestock, but likely no birds because the air wouldn’t have been clean enough for them yet.\n\nLife for these first few generations was probably pretty miserable, even by what we see at the Torean poles today. The AIs were still completing their program of habitat creation, and to them the humans were little more than lab rats and plough-mares. The ziggurat was a castle of horrors full of biological experimentation and vat-grown chimeras. We think that this work resulted in tissue cultures that are still alive as membranes inside the atmosphere generators today.\n\nThis period when Torean humans lived only inside the ziggurats is somewhat hard to pin down, historically. Most of what we have is myth from the humans and propaganda from the AIs, so who knows what to believe. All we can really say is that this period marked the development of the current social system at the poles.\n\n[[Return to the index.-&gt;Guide]]",
  "Husbandry": "The goal of the AIs was to make Torei habitable for normal humans, but the death rate among the early populations was too high. The bio-engineering research program produced humans who were more durable, and could withstand more of the half-made world. Specialized organisms were seeded at the equator, to try and build up biomass where the conditions were most favorable. Life on Torei began slowly to step outside, but it was all strange new breeds meant specifically for that world.\n\nSince this was a breeding program, the human genotype was altered to produce nine females for every male. The reproductive systems and sexual drives of these humans were cranked up to unusual levels for maximal fertility. Each man would impregnate one woman per month, like clockwork. The population grew and new levels were built to make the ziggurats we know today.\n\nControlling such a population was not the same task as it had been before. During each pole’s summer, when the sun did not set, humans were let out onto the planet’s surface in laminate environment suits. These were an early form of today’s isolation laminates that the Emissaries wear, and they did far less. The wearer was protected from the unfinished atmosphere outside, and infosystems in the helmet kept the AI in control of what the occupant saw and heard.\n\nWhat originally started as an environment suit for humans being let outside soon became a population control mechanism. A misbehaving colonist could be locked into one of these suits and made to act as an internal police force. The suits could simulate almost any sensation to the wearer’s flesh, which made it an efficient system for re-training.\n\nThe colonists’ ramped-up sex drive and lack of almost any other means of entertainment meant that the AIs had a convenient reward system. Pain is always an effective punishment, but the AIs learned how to prey on a person’s fears and desires. What we’ve seen in the present day suggests that even a limited time in the isolation suits completely changes a person. And this was important, because if the AIs were going to start actual farms on the equator, they’d need to be able to trust the farmers.\n\n[[Return to the index.-&gt;Guide]]",
  "Farmers": "I’m not a geologist, but even I am stunned by the dramatic difference between the equatorial band and the rest of Torei. You can drive around in the badlands for days without seeing anything but igneous and metamorphic rocks. You joyride down dusty craters, follow fissures down tectonic thrusts, and then suddenly out of nowhere everything is covered in lichen.\n\nIf you turn in the direction of the blooms, you start to see little green shoots in the dusty cracks, here and there. Plants with long taproots extend fern-like fronds up to the daylight. And as you continue, within only a short time you find yourself on a dirt-like surface driving through low scrub. You can tell your latitude to a novel degree of accuracy simply by looking at vegetation around you. There’s a reason the planet’s flag has that green belt around the globe.\n\nWhat’s also interesting is when you dig down through equatorial soil. The topsoil itself is very thin, but well-managed as a sort of sacred trust. But once you lift that off, you find caustic stuff that could make for devastating dust storms if allowed to become airborne. Early farms were planted just to control this layer of atmospheric fallout and keep it buried where it wouldn’t be a problem any more. Ask a Pembric plantation master about “leechcorn” some time, and you’ll get an amazing education in bioremediation techniques!\n\nThe farms were a success, in small part thanks to the controlled watering the equator gets. The AIs control underground aquifers via long tunnels that are off limits to most humans. When it’s time for crop watering, they engineer rain showers that bathe a portion of the equatorial region. It’s run like clockwork, and typically during the evening. You sometimes see the rain schedule next to the train timetables, for example.\n\nAt this point, the habitat creation project sadly stalled. The AIs needed the farms to supply its biotech machines with ingredients, and the humans needed the AIs to keep the rain falling and the air flowing. As one of the old poems put it (and apologies for my somewhat unskilled translation): “And the Dæmons kept dominion of the sky, and Men claimed dominion of the land.”\n\n[[Return to the index.-&gt;Guide]]",
  "Sharecrop": "Of course, the “Dæmons” kept dominion over the humans, as well. The end of expansion on Torei meant that there weren’t enough isolation suits for all of the troublemakers, but the ones that were bound in them made effective police for the rest. Well, at least for a while, anyway.\n\nThe problem with releasing an incredibly randy and fertile population to the furthest corner of a planet from your control is that your carefully controlled breeding program will go wildly off course. It didn’t take many generations for the natural-born humans at the equator to see the isolates as foreign oppressors and set plans to overthrow them. This begins what is possibly the bloodiest time in Torei’s history, which Toreologists have come to call the Sharecropping Wars.\n\nAt first, the AIs saw this population as expendable, and simply eradicated whole towns when it encountered trouble. There were usually enough people inside the ziggurats who were willing to colonize an evacuated farmstead and live out under the Torean sun. But eventually the costs of this became clear to both sides.\n\nThe exterminations and re-population efforts brought more and more humans over to the revolutionary side. Furthermore, the rebel humans had taken to destroying the crops that were destined for the ziggurats. A human colony could survive on tubers and ruminant milk for a year if they had to, but a critical missed shipment of seed oils or other organic chemical ingredients could mean trouble for the whole planet. Time and again, the humans showed the AIs that they were willing to ignore the threat of ecological disaster in pursuit of independence.\n\nThis is something that seems predictable to you or I, but the AIs genuinely seemed to have trouble accepting it. They kept up their program of recolonization for over a century before finally recognizing the equatorial ring as independent. Now the “Dæmons” became “Emissaries”, and they negotiated air and water rights in exchange for necessary crops. They traded technology for the food needed to keep the population in the ziggurats alive.\n\nFrom this point on, aside from the occasional nation that tested the AIs’ wrath or surrendered sovereignty to one of the Emissaries, the political role of the AIs remained in this stalemate nearly into the present day. For a thousand years, humanity was able to build its own society on the equator, and the “ringdoms” as we now call them were formed.\n\n[[Return to the index.-&gt;Guide]]",
  "FreeHuman": "The politics get boring for a while here, but wars are now waged between the ringdoms more often. Alliances form, nations conquer other nations, and realms are partitioned up for heirs who then fight one another. Throughout all of this, the threat of interference by the AIs looms.\n\nIt’s not really useful as a scholarly classification, but I find it’s easiest to describe this period to people as feudal. The culture was based heavily on male inheritance of arable land, and conduct of war was often regulated by the AIs. Commonly, when a dispute between ringdoms broke out, war would be a last resort after bringing the case to an Emissary.\n\nThe art from this period often depicts the AIs as turbulent gods, bringing bounty and destruction on ineffable whims. The laws of men could be appealed to an Emissary, but the result would sometimes leave everyone suffering. Humanity wrestled with its relationship to the AIs, hating and fearing and ultimately relying on them even in independence.\n\nFor a time, a class of priestesses emerged, promising to interpret the “Dæmons” for their masters. The story goes that an Isolate raped the women of a powerful landlord, to threaten the legitimacy of any heirs. The daughters of these unions were believed to have insight into the AIs, and allegedly they were seen talking to their biological father (a difficult claim to prove, as all male Isolates effectively look the same). These women were ejected from the estate their mothers belonged to, and began prophesying in the streets on market days. Their prescience became legendary, and soon it became common for stray women to claim insight into the plans of the AIs.\n\nThis trend improved the lot of unowned women immensely over the years. Originally the term “freewomb” meant a woman whose children were not by her owner, but the word soon came to mean the children themselves. Cast out of an estate, these girls had to make their way alone in societies that did not consciously value the roles they could play. A lack of loyalties made them neutral mediators, taking over some of the roles that the Emissaries had performed before independence. But the association with Dæmon-scrying proved devastating.\n\n[[Return to the index.-&gt;Guide]]",
  "PrinceThrall": "There are Toreologists who spend their whole careers studying just one period for one house of one nation during the warring states era. Land and loyalties switched around like plains rivers during a storm, but a stalemate between five remaining ringdoms held off unification for three generations. The details of this struggle make up much of the high art on Torei, and people sometimes identify culturally by which of the five empires they descend from rather than which of the current ringdoms they currently live.\n\nThere was a courtesan named Theca or Nebla (depending on the language of the tale), and the emperor of Falon made a grand present of her to the emperor of Prellatia. This gift was part of a court gesture of great magnitude, but war demanded the Falonian emperor’s attention at the home front. So he locked her into Falon’s symbols of state (scepter, crown, and boots) and sent her along with an escort formed of his most trusted palace guards. He would be present in a ceremonial sense, and would arrive in person later to wear the diadem once more.\n\nBy the time Theca reached Prellatia, the war in Falon had claimed the lives of the four emperors. The Prellatian emperor gloated, and tried to take the crown from Theca’s head. Her guards dispatched this ruler expertly, and in a legendary battle managed to hold the Prellatian palace.\n\nThere were further battles, but within a year all of the noble houses on Torei were swayed by Theca’s calls for peace. She was but a slave, yet she wore the Falonian and Prellation crowns. She seduced hundreds of powerful men who came to her court, and each man felt he owned a piece of her. The planet was tired of war, and Theca offered a new model for human self-rule.\n\nIn a coronation ceremony that is the subject of all the great murals and hangings on Torei, she bound herself with circlets made from the crowns of the five empires: one on each ankle, one on each wrist, and Falon’s about her throat. The remaining symbols of state were made into a multi-colored chain that kept her locked to the throne for the rest of her life. Torei now knew life without war for the first time since it had settled the equator.\n\n[[Return to the index.-&gt;Guide]]",
  "PolarRelations": "With the ringdoms no longer fractured, the need for Emissary intervention or alliances with the poles almost vanished overnight. People worried what the Dæmons would do at first, but soon forgot their fears: the rains kept coming on schedule and no waves of slick black bodies descended on their habitations.\n\nThe polar AIs, for their part, seemed to enjoy this era of peace. Without war to sap resources, the cost of equatorial goods went down. They exported fewer engines of war and more agricultural and lifestyle goods. The peace dividend seemed to pay out to everyone.\n\nUnfortunately, the freewombs on the streets suffered terribly. With a culture no longer nervous about the mood of the polar Dæmons, they soon found themselves scapegoats for all kinds of problems. During the Princess Thrall’s rule, the ruling houses enacted hundreds of strict laws governing their lives. Many sought enslavement in poor houses to escape persecution, but most soldiered on in the oppressive regime.\n\nAfter the death of the Princess Thrall, the Council of Regents continued to meet and honor the peace for some time. One woman would be offered up from each of the original five empires per year, and chained to the throne as a group. Many of the festival queens you see today are inspired by this tradition.\n\n[[Return to the index.-&gt;Guide]]",
  "Dissolution": "With human society stable and peaceful, it was only a matter of time before revolutionary thinking cropped up again. This time it was more of a nationalist flavor. In the time since the wars, local cultures had a chance to flourish. Language was largely uniform thanks to the AIs’ influence on communication, but customs and traditions gave people a national identity that they wanted to see reflected.\n\nOver the next two centuries, local independence movements chipped away at the authority of the Council of Regents. Some set up their own copies of the Council, claiming authority over all of Torei. Some brought in polar Emissaries and boasted that they’d bring back the heroic age that had settled their land. In all, the Regents were as tone-deaf as the AIs had been, and they responded to uprisings with brutality.\n\nOnce the dust settled, the rough borders of modern Torei were laid down. One can look at a map of Torei from three hundred years ago and still identify almost all of the nations based on a modern atlas. Unity was gone, but trade struggles replaced war as the means for jockeying among the ringdoms. The AIs had become experts at the use of political economy to control the human settlements, as the ringdoms weren’t so eager to sacrifice quality of life once they’d re-gained stability.\n\nAnd who knows where Torei would have gone if this had been allowed to continue?\n\n[[Return to the index.-&gt;Guide]]",
  "Discvoer": "All the guidebooks tell you, Cmdr. Stave Fedman was the first human from mainstream intergalactic civilization to visit Torei. While it’s true that he was the first to join Torei and the rest of humanity in contact, there is ample evidence that others discovered Torei’s stars long before this.\n\nWe have records of a pirate fleet from the early days of Andromedan colonization. The logs hint of a “cache of starrs(sic)” where their plundered booty could be staged far from intergalactic jump points. Some micro-asteroids found around other stars in Torei’s cluster are believed to be wreckage from an orbital battle, but little conclusive evidence has been collected.\n\nThe AIs themselves have marked certain ravines and cave systems on Torei as off-limits to humanity. Some of the more creative analysis of long-range reconnaissance hints at a structure shaped rather like the hull of a long-space frigate of the sort used five thousand years ago. It’s sketchy at best, but it’s at least somewhat corroborated by faint burn marks on the surface rock when the regolith layer is cleared by wind.\n\nAt any rate, Torean humans themselves had no contact with the outside world until Commander Fedman’s expedition. Torei’s cluster had been known since regular passage to Andromeda had opened up, but the cost of visiting it hadn’t been justifiable. Once the cost of habitable land in the Milky Way had climbed back up and the technology for space travel had advanced enough, it was only a matter of time before someone visited each little isolated star out in intergalactic space hoping for a homestead.\n\nFedman’s diaries were cleaned up for the official record, but at least three versions claiming to be the originals can be found in bookshops all over Torei. Each one tells a slightly different tale of the debauchery and revelry he engaged in on his visit, but they’re all really based on interviews with his crew.\n\n[[Return to the index.-&gt;Guide]]",
  "ORTrade": "The ringdoms built landing pads to attract visiting ships, but all of the orbital infrastructure was controlled by the AIs. Voidcraft would stay in a solar orbit for ages before being permitted to even approach a Torean orbit. The AIs vetted and quarantined visitors fastidiously. When a ship was allowed to the surface, the humans paid top prices for any cargo aboard.\n\nAt first, the humans bartered: the AIs had spent tens of thousands of years perfecting genetic manipulation and biotechnology as part of the habitat creation project, and Torei had the capacity for medical services unavailable anywhere else in the cosmos. Eventually all of the nations were able to trade in common currency, and word started to get out that they paid handsomely for certain cargoes.\n\nA flotilla of rough trading ships sat idle in orbit of Torei’s star, each waiting for permission from the Dæmon Dockmasters to land. From time to time a chaff-runner would make an attempt at unauthorized landing, and some would succeed. The AIs dutifully broadcast the registration IDs of all impounded vessels, and there are some downright chilling recordings from the captured pilots who claimed to have “defected” to Dahom or Mazos.\n\nIn retrospect it’s obvious why the AIs were so picky, but at the time they seemed as mysterious to us as they did to the Torean humans. The AIs were still pulling the strings of the human economy, and wanted a surplus in goods needed at the ziggurats and a deficit of items needed at the equator. So generally a lot of food and water and hydrocarbon mixtures made it through, while processed goods and technology stayed in orbit.\n\n[[Return to the index.-&gt;Guide]]",
  "Gunboat": "Unfortunately for the AIs, it was the manufacturers of technology and processed goods that had the strongest space forces. The Zanweg Cartel sent an armada directly into Torean geosynchronous orbit and began to lower a tether to the peak of the highest mountain on Torei’s equator. With fighter escorts running interference swarm patterns around the tether, a full-scale orbital lift was built along it’s length.\n\nThe space elevator on Torei changed everything. The mountain it was built on was not very high, but it never had a chance to build up any soil layer of note. It had been disputed territory for centuries, and several ringdoms that abutted it considered it a national treasure. Once the base anchor port was completed, the borders were formalized and the tower was declared a neutral intergalactic trade zone, and all ringdoms on that side of the planet were granted access corridors to the base.\n\nOnce trade in industrial goods opened up, the neighboring ringdoms were able to build vast tower arcologies around the planetside port spire. The more wealthy nations were able to build skybridges to the orbital lift tower from the tops of their own structures. It’s a common for a vast city to spring up around one of these, but Torei has over a dozen!\n\nI said this was unfortunate for the AIs, and it really was. The economy has swung out of their control, and the habitat-creation project is seriously compromised by this. If the planet never becomes self-sustaining, they may resort to force once more. It remains to be seen how well Mazos and Dahom adapt to this new reality. They’ve been slow to change before, probably because a biosphere-building project requires a very patient long-term mindset, and they seem to treat the human economy as yet another ecological system.\n\n[[Return to the index.-&gt;Guide]]",
  "Future": "The ringdoms seem to be doing a brisk business in sex tourism, tax havens, and basic medical services. The AIs could outclass them on the last one, if they ever decided to. Of course, it could lead to their biotech secrets getting out, which would ruin any advantage they have.\n\nThe AIs have always held control over the badlands, but they appear to be stepping up their game lately. Word is that they’re losing population and have to spend more and more of their resources sending Emissaries further and further afield. The unrest at the poles is helped by agitator-liberator groups that run a sort of underground railroad to help people flee to the ringdoms.\n\nOne of the reasons the AIs are stretched thin is that they’ve begun to maintain a space fleet. It’s a rag-tag collection of used and commandeered vessels, but they’ve been spotted at ports in three galaxies. They may be trying to export their services, and they seem to buy exactly the same things they’ve always needed.\n\nAnd of course Torean expansion to other stars was always part of their mandate. The Dockmaster is largely silent, and only issues quarantine orders from time to time. It could be busy managing the polar fleets and preparing for conquest. We just have no way of knowing.\n\n[[Return to the index.-&gt;Guide]]",

Only then would the soubrette above you be pleased, after all, and if she was not she most *certainly* would make sure your Mistress was aware.  \n\nShe glances pointedly down once you finally inch away, but appears satisfied.  “Very good, Cici!”\n\nYou feel full, and worse—or perhaps better—increasingly *aroused*.  It wasn’t the same as your butt-plug could induce, or a hand between your legs.  That was sweet and simple, the source clear, the build towards climax easily charted.  This is something else,  something harder to define.  A background sensation you could not shake, a whisper just out of earshot that promised your every carnal delight.  Bound and gagged, collared and locked into tight laminate, your daily meal ensured you thought of little else besides your cunt.\n\n[[Moan lewdly.-&gt;CatMM]]\n[[Show your appreciation, lick her boots.-&gt;CatBoot]]  ",

Even then you cannot bring yourself to believe it, not until the secretarial slave asks her name, and she responds.\n\n“Corinth Sylvette.”\n\nThe last few months at the Academy had seen you transformed, adapting to your new role upon Torei, and the same seems true for Corinth—in a most spectacular fashion.  Your memories may still be less than whole, but the woman who approaches your cage after signing off with the secretary very much looks the part of a Torean Mistress, with little of the Corinth you remember.  Tall knee high stiletto heels add an imperious snap to every step she takes, while the laminate one piece she wore seemed to demand attention, even if the long coat of a similar midnight color kept her dignity. Even her crimson-painted lips seem to dictate, not merely speak the word that emerges as greeting.\n\n“Hey.”  It hangs in the air between you, filling further and further with your apprehension.  Yet then she smiles, relaxing just a bit, and there the Corinth you remember spills out from the mask of the steely Mistress.  Not a disguise, you conclude, but a new Corinth.  Lost and reveling in the wonders of Torei.\n\n“Try not to stare *too* much,” she teases, still holding that smile.  “And get on your knees,  uh, *slave*.”\n\n[[“You look so different!&quot;-&gt;CorEnd4Oops]]\n[[“…yes, Mistress.”-&gt;CorEnd4]]",
  "CorEnd4Oops": "The smoky makeup around her eyes makes the shifting of her brows, furrowing a bit in legitimate displeasure, all the more obvious.  “There will be time to talk, but you must remember your place.  *On your knees.*”\n\nShe does not sound liable to ask nicely again.\n\n[[“…yes, Mistress.”-&gt;CorEnd4]]",
  "CorEnd4": "Moving to your knees, spreading your legs and bowing your head as you had been taught, Corinth opens the cell door.  She seems even taller as she stands above you, brushing a bit of your hair away from your shoulders.  Reaching to her purse she produces a black circlet of what your furtive glances first presume to be laminate, but the weight with which she handles it suggests a steel core at the very least.  You realize the intention immediately.  A collar.  *Your* new collar.\n(set: $Inv to (a:))\n(if: $CorOverride is true)[“Seems our little plan went perfectly,](else: )[“I just knew you would be listed for auction eventually,]” she asserts.  “Even so… it is a bit hard to believe this is where we are, huh?  I certainly never thought I would cash out from our, well former, employer.  Stay on Torei.  But… mhm, I did, didn’t I?”\n\nShe lowers the collar, lining it up with your throat as much as allowing you to examine it closer.  It is indeed coated in a thin aesthetic layer of laminate, yet with careful engraving that allowed the silver of the steel beneath to shine through, spelling out a short statement: *Property of Mistress Sylvette.*\n(if: not ($Inv contains &quot;Corinth&#39;s collar&quot;))[(set: $Inv to $Inv + (a: &quot;Corinth&#39;s collar&quot;))]\n(colour: red)[Corinth&#39;s Collar added!]\n\n“Ready to enter my service?”\n\n[[“Yes, Mistress.”-&gt;CorEnd5A]]\n[[“Of course!”-&gt;CorEnd5B]]",

That of a slave, owned by the Mistress above you.\n\nTo the collar a short length of chain is then attached, a leash, which Corinth tugs to bring you to your feet.  “Let’s get out of here, yeah?  We don’t need to hurry, but we also shouldn’t just waste time hanging about the market.  I setup dinner reservations for us, to celebrate the new… relationship, between us.

  "CorEndMin": "“Yeah, of course!”  Corinth replies.  “It’s almost a tradition on Torei, you know, to make such an appointment after buying a slave from auction or wherever.  There are so many ways to improve a slave, and the Ministry is so inexpensive for many procedures so it just makes sense, you know?  Nothing too dramatic, so no need to worry.  Just going to fill out your measurements a bit, bust and hips, thighs too.  Have your tracking chip updated with my credentials, a set of rainbow controls, adjust your gag reflex… hmm, ah!  The most important part!”\n\nLooking over her shoulder, she winks.  “I have a thing for red-heads, so… get ready for *that.*”\n\n[[“You’re… really serious about this…”-&gt;CorEndSer]]\n[[“I understand, Mistress.”-&gt;CorEnd6]]",
  "CorEnd6": "“Great!”  Your Mistress enthuses, leading you onward.  “Let’s get to it, yeah?”\n\nIt’s rhetorical, you lost your right to decide months back after all.  And much like your time at the Academy the next few hours pass quickly, even if you’re rendered unconscious for some of them.  The Ministry of Improvements, your submission to the waiting Lancers there… it all passes in a blur.\n\n[[Your collar remains, however.  Always there, tight and unyielding.-&gt;CorEnd7]]",

You should know better than most how easily it is for a freewomb to find herself in a collar, hmm?”\n\nShe runs a fingernail along yours, smiling.  “Luckily you’re in mine.”\n\n[[“I… see, Mistress.”-&gt;CorEnd6]]",

Club Lush, at one of the private tables in the VIP section above the general dance floor.  Corinth’s dinner date, as planned, your visit to the Ministry of Improvements already completed.  \n\nGlancing down, you take in the dress Corinth had picked for you—a long laminate ensemble matched with gloves and heels.  Laminate thinwear even provided for your sheer stockings.  Of course your collar remained as well, as tight as ever, but she had accessorized it as well by utilizing the hardpoints on the side for a set of short laminate straps.  It may be absent for the time, but affixing a gag of some sort would take only moments.\n\n“I was saying you may drop protocol,” your date, and owner, explains over a charming smile from her seat across the table.  She too had utilized a wardrobe, acquiring a corset.  Her coat remained as well, but was seated on the curve of the small booth between you both.  “You may ask any question you like.  I’m sure you have plenty.”\n\n[[Examine yourself.

I’m a liaison now, for Expedition Torei.  It’s an offworlder firm, obviously given the name, that provides guided experiences for tourists a bit wary of the… let us call it “unbridled” Torean experience.  That’s how I make my credits, and how I could afford you.”\n\n[[“Well… you certainly look different.”-&gt;CorLook]]\n[[“Was I expensive?”-&gt;CorExpense]]\n[[“You must have a home on Torei, then?”-&gt;CorHome]]\n[[“Can I ask about something else, Mistress?”-&gt;CorDate]]",

Of the meal itself however, compliments are harder to find.  Corinth had ordered it for you, the proper name being Slave Feed, but it looks to you like a white oatmeal.  There is no smell, nor any real indication of attendant flavor.\n\n[[“I don’t… really need to eat this, right?&quot;-&gt;FeedAsk]]\n[[“I’m not eating this, Corinth.&quot;-&gt;FeedNo]]\n[[Take a few bites.-&gt;Feed1]]\n[[Pull back, don’t eat any for now.-&gt;CorDate]]\n](if: $Strike is 1)[You know now the slave feed in your bowl lacks flavor or much satisfaction, but you can already feel the nutritional value—the hunger that had been burning in your stomach is already somewhat sated.\n\n\n[[“I don’t… really need to eat this, right?&quot;-&gt;FeedAsk]]\n[[“I’m not eating this, Corinth.&quot;-&gt;FeedNo]]\n[[Take a few more bites.-&gt;Feed2]]\n[[Pull back, don’t eat any for now.-&gt;CorDate]]\n](if: $Strike is 2)[Only a bit more remains of your dinner, the Slave Feed having been mostly consumed.\n\n[[Take a few more bites.-&gt;Feed3]]\n[[Pull back, don’t eat any for now.-&gt;CorDate]]\n]",

My looking the part of a proper Mistress helps sell the experience.  And you know the saying: dress for success, right?  Truant Officers and other bothersome people here don’t often bother someone who looks one,” she counts off her finger, “Torean and two, like she means business.”\n\nThat last line is delivered with sudden fearsomeness, your widened eyes earning a second laugh from the Mistress.  “And, you know, there was you to consider.  If I was going to make a serious attempt to go after you, to do this… whole thing, I felt I had to earn the *right* to own a slave.  Look the part, be the part, that sort of thing.”\n\nShe leans over the table, biting her bottom lip.  “Do you like it?”\n\n[[“I do!  You really own it, Corinth.”-&gt;YesDress]]\n[[“Yes.

One of those Academy Dolls, or a proper fully certified soubrette, those can break a bank.  Otherwise its not out of reach for most who live on this planet to own at least one slave, there are just so many collared girls—and the occasional man, available.”\n\nShe shrugs.  “Point is, I got the one I wanted.  And your time at the Academy ensures you’re useful to me immediately, if we’re looking at it from a less… romantic view.  In a few years I hope to own at least a half dozen collared girls.”\n\n[[“A half dozen?  Why?”-&gt;CorDozen]]\n[[“I thought… it would be just me.”-&gt;CorMe]]\n[[“Can we talk about you?

You know, d-rings and hardpoints around the bed frame, suspension fittings on some parts of the ceiling…” she winks.  “The fun stuff.”\n\n[[“Can we talk about you?

  "CorExam": "You look down, to the expanse of red laminate that constituted your dress for the evening.  The material is as glossy and tight as any other you’ve worn upon Torei, but it’s the way you fill it out that feels so remarkably different.  \n\nThe Ministry of Improvements had made several changes to you, adding to the work done during your time at the Academy, as requested by your so newly established Mistress.  You had been a bit on the lean side upon arriving on Torei, months ago, but now your curves press against the laminate readily.  At chest and hips your measurements have been adjusted towards the bountiful norm that Torei—and most men you had ever met—seemed to prefer.  Even without a corset your waist presents a nicely tapered look as well, only adding to the effect.  \n\nIt’s harder to observe, but a glance towards any mirror would reveal your hair to be a bright and insistent red now—the color as bold as it is now natural, the Ministry’s work going further then simply dyes.  Below the neck you’ve been denuded of hair, although that matched galactic sensibilities as much as Torean ones.  \n\nYet its something *else* that had drawn your attention downward in the first place, a trembling sensation of… aching desire, far stronger than you had ever known, between your legs.  You’re dressed in laminate, collared at the throat, but you should not be *this* horny.\n\nAcross the table, Corinth tips her head curiously.  “Problem?”\n\n[[“N-No, Mistress…”-&gt;CorAANo]]\n[[“I’m… wet, Mistress.”-&gt;CorAAYes]]",

But they’re actually quite useful, it turns out.  My set here has a projected HUD, allows me to monitor things… I used it to great effect at the auction, obviously.”\n\nShe replaces them upon her face, and you do indeed notice a holographic glint over the lenses now that you’re looking for it.\n\n[[“Was I expensive?”-&gt;CorExpense]]\n[[“You must have a home on Torei, then?”-&gt;CorHome]]\n[[“Can I ask about something else, Mistress?”-&gt;CorDate]]",

Your time at the Academy provides the rest, the training they had drilled into you shining through.  \n\n“So, now that we have that established, what does your collar *mean*?”  Corinth asks again.\n\n[[“That I’m your property.”-&gt;CorAskProp]]\n(if: $CorOverride is true)[[[“That we can be together, as we talked about.”-&gt;CorAskTogether]]](else: )[[[&quot;That we can be together, as... partners.&quot;-&gt;CorAskTogether]]]",

  "CorBasic": "Corinth’s lips pull together tightly, her eyebrows rising with a hint of surprise and consternation.  “Well… that’s understandable, I suppose.”\n\nHer disappointment fades, replaced by a look you had often seen from the Academy’s Headmistress—generally right before you were told to do something, regardless of your thoughts on the matter.\n\n“I’ll treat you as my slave, going forward.

Corinth had always worn her feelings on her shoulder, and she wasn’t about to stop now.\n\n[[…sex slave?”-&gt;CorSex]]\n[[“What do you expect of me, then?-&gt;CorExpect]]\n[[“What will my duties be?”-&gt;CorDuties]]",
  "CorExpect": "“Expectations, right, yes.”  Collecting herself, Corinth quickly demonstrates she had given the matter considerable prior thought.  “You’re a slave now and will be treated as and kept in the traditional Torean manner.  I expect you to be submissive and dutiful, always minding your manners.  You must recognize that you are now property.  *My* property.  I intend to keep you bound in most circumstances, and of course you will be wearing laminate only going forward.  Textiles are far too expensive to import, and I very much like the way you wear it.”\n\nShe pauses to take a sip of her drink but isn’t done yet.  “I will be watching you closely and correcting you if the need arises.  I don’t intend to be harsh, but I will strive to be strict with you.”\n\n[[“What will my duties be?”-&gt;CorDuties]]\n[[“I… understand, everything I mean.”-&gt;CorAskBr]]",

  "CorSex": "“Concubine is the ‘proper’ term,” Corinth replies, even raising her hands to mimic quotation marks upon the word ‘proper’.  “But… yeah.  Torei has a long history of girls like you.  It would make more sense, financially, to put you to work—but having a concubine is a prestige thing.  So you will be attending me to social events… like this Club, and I’ve prepared a set of restraints for you to wear to bed—ah!

  "CorAANo": "“I *did* say you weren’t under normal protocols, so I won’t punish you for lying to me… but you are lying, aren’t you?”  If you expected a reprimand, what follows is a surprise.  “You shouldn’t do that, not with me.  It is important for our relationship that you always be open with me, alright?  No secrets between us.”\n\nCorinth leans in a bit.  “So, come on.  What’s bothering you?”\n\n[[“I’m… wet, Mistress.”-&gt;CorAAYes]]",
  "CorAAYes": "“Oh?”  Corinth’s smile is radiant, her raven hair framing the grin.  “I would hope so, I spent good credits at the Ministry to ensure you generally are.

The command is made apparent, even if it goes unspoken.  To your left and behind the sound of chains and straining straps announce your team rousing, and you join with them.  From your kneeling position of rest you return to your feet, a difficult maneuver given your bondage but you’re well practiced by now.\n\nYour uniform is red and black laminate, the harness locked across your body the former, boots and armbinder the latter.  A garter belt at your waist nevertheless exposes your womanhood, ponies were kept in such a manner as per regulations, but it does at least hook to the stockings that emerge from your boots.  *Those* are your most undoubtedly Torean feature, the knee high pieces of equipment adding a full foot to your height.  Steel hooves nailed to the bottom of each ensured your footing, but it was the recurved blade that ran from them up to where your foot actually began that gave you the lengthy, loping gallop required of a ponyslave.  Such boots defined you in fact, the Ministry of Improvements having not only adapted you to wearing them, but having done so in a way that made standing flat-footed difficult.  Pure endurance training had provided the rest.\n\nYet such thoughts are far from your mind as you wait in trembling anticipation, beneath the appalling heat of rural Aekora.  Amongst the lichen fields near the Badlands there was little shade, and your assigned handlers generally kept you from it as a matter of principle.  Your skin is well tanned as a result, amply on display to allow your sweat to run freely.  \n\n[[You bite down on your bit nervously.-&gt;Pony4]]",
  "Pony4": "As always, your bit gives you comfort.  Laminate-padded steel, it is secured firmly between your teeth by the head harness you wear.  Decorative feathers arise from your temples, red colored to match your uniform, while blinders to each side conspire with the posture collar at your throat to ensure you cannot look anywhere but forward.  It kept you, *forced you*, to focus only on marching once the command came.\n\nIt does not come yet, however.  Voices behind you talk casually, your handlers for the day discussing their plans.  You merely try to ignore the bit of sweat that runs down your brow, a welcome gust of wind proving so very cool as it tousles your hair.  Like the others the sides of your head have been shaved, leaving a mane that ended in a ponytail and red bow at your mid-back.  \n\nA bit further down, on your left buttock, was your brand.  The Ministry of Truants’ symbol, the same all in their stable shared, encircling your new name.  Or more precisely, number.  5-6, for Precinct 5, Ponyslave 6.  The same marker is on your garter belt, above your cunt, and stamped on the exterior of each of your blinders.  \n\n[[Your harness shifts slightly, as behind you the cart you’re affixed to is boarded.

Leaning into your harness, you trust it to keep you upright as you dig your hooves into the ground for traction.

  "GoodPunish3": "“I know, Cici, I know…” the words barely break through the haze of your lust, bleary eyes blinking as you recognize your Mistress before you.  Her hand pats your cheek, the sheer sensation of another’s touch maddening.  “I hope this will be a night you never forget…”\n\nShe stands, and behind you the machine engages.  The cock buried within you pulls out, inch by enraptured inch.  Your hormone-addled body can hardly track it, synapses burn the feeling into one elongated experience—that ends with a **bang** as the cock is suddenly drilled into you.\n\nYou cum there, *hard*.  An orgasmic moan slips your gags as your abdomen aches, the muscles of your womanhood suckling on the cock within you as the ecstasy blasts through you, wave after wave.  You had reached climax, then rocketed off it—the phallus having paused fully hilted inside as you quiver in glorious rapture.  Yet as soon as the afterglow hits, finding you panting in your bondage, the cock begins again.  You don’t think it possible, but the pheromones and your Torean libido rise immediately to the challenge.  How many times will you cum tonight?  Forty times?  A hundred?  \n\n“Remember,” Alexandra says, somewhere atop her bed.  She must be securing her other slave.  “Remember that I love you, Cici.”\n\n[[As your cock slams home again, you know you love her too.  Who else could make you feel this way?-&gt;Ending]]",
  "CatMedium": "It takes a bit more fiddling, and twice more you moan lewdly, but eventually the piston-mounted cock hilts itself within your waiting mouth.  “You will be pleasing the cock tonight, *all night*,” your Mistress explains.  “So that come morning, you have the proper motivation to seek out your toy.  If you manage to catch it, perhaps tomorrow I will use this machine on your pussy.”\n\nThe machine shifts, driving deeper into your mouth until your lips are pressed against the laminate phallus’ base.  Your gag reflex had been overwritten by the Ministry of Improvements.  As it withdraws, Alexandra claps her hands together.  “Excellent!  But… I do have a bit more motivation.”\n\nCrossing to the dresser directly before you, she pulls from it a small spray bottle.  One you know, twin reactions welling within you at the sight of it: fear and a perverse, intense desire.\n\nTorean catnip.\n\n[[You struggle, moaning.-&gt;CatMedium2]]",
  "CatMedium2": "Pulling against your restraints does little, the bondage as heavy as it is total.  Only your head can move with some freedom, but you cannot avoid when your Mistress holds the bottle before the cage and sprays you—directly in the face.\n\nThe effect is nearly immediate.  Torean slave feed may have been uniform, consistent, but it was common practice to introduce additives catered to each slave.  To yours a strong pheromone was added, one that induced intense and inescapable ecstasy.  But it was dormant, merely lurking in your bloodstream until activated… by that small spray bottle.\n\nYou moan immediately, wriggling in your restraints as your legs try to close, to come together.  But you cannot move, cannot reach your suddenly burning cunt, cannot shove the cock any further into your throat.  Any sense of dignity that remained to you, anything that resemble rational thought or effort leaves you.  In that short moment you’re reduced to an animal in intense heat, your own cunt the very center of your universe.

The cock buried within you pulls out, inch by enraptured inch.  Your hormone-addled body can hardly track it, synapses burn the feeling into one elongated experience—that ends with a **bang** as the cock is suddenly drilled between your full lips once more.\n\nYou nearly gag on it, from the simple ecstasy of it all instead of any reflex, but the machine is unyielding.  Already it’s pulling out, and you breath deeply, panting through your nose as your hips rock back and forth in frustration.  Soon it comes again, and again, and again.  Incapable of sating your desire, but still requiring your full attention. \n\n“Remember,” Alexandra says, somewhere atop her bed.

  "CorExam2": "“Well allow me to jog that memory,” she responds, adjusting her glasses slightly.\n\nCorinth leans back into the plush material of the booth, glancing out at Club Lush before returning her attention to you alone.  “You probably know better than I that Torei sort of functions on… arousal, right?  Because natural-born Toreans just can’t seem to stop thinking about sex, and all that.  If we’re to stay here on Torei, I thought it best we be able to keep up.  So at the Ministry of Improvements I had your libido, your sex drive, increased to Torean levels.  It was just a shot, actually.  Can you believe that?

We’re not really in a position to throw stones or whatever, but still.  Couldn’t blame them anyway.”\n\nShe shrugs a bit, her bared shoulders and the arousal in question making the simple gesture almost alluring.  “That was just the first improvement I made to you, of course.”\n\n[[“Wait, you said ‘it is best WE be able to keep up’?”-&gt;ExamWe]]\n[[“Can this be reversed?”-&gt;ExamReverse]]\n[[&quot;What about those other improvements?&quot;-&gt;ExamOther]]",
  "ExamWe": "“Oh, ha—good catch,” your Mistress chuckles.  Looking down at herself, as if taking in what Torei had done to her, her smile only widens as she eventually gestures towards herself with both hands.  “I had the same boosters applied.  Of a lesser grade, to keep things more rational.  But still.  A Mistress has expectations as well.”\n\nHer teeth gleam as she bares them, the smile turning predatory.  “And of course it helps justify keeping a concubine slave, doesn’t it?  Especially one with all the different improvements I made to her.”\n\n[[“This is… how I’m always going to feel?”-&gt;ExamFeel]]\n[[“Can this be reversed?”-&gt;ExamReverse]]\n[[&quot;What about those other improvements?&quot;-&gt;ExamOther]]",
  "ExamReverse": "“It can,” Corinth notes, shrugging.  “Stopping the supplements would keep you from reaching the highest of the highs, so to speak.  And full reversal would require another shot, or some such, I’m sure.  Torei biomedical skill is incredible after all.  But why are you worrying about that?  Don’t you *want* to be the slut?”\n\n[[“I do, Mistress!”-&gt;RevBest]]\n[[“…yes.”-&gt;RevMid]]\n[[“No, Corinth!”-&gt;RevLow]]",
  "ExamOther": "“Oh, well those are more obvious mostly.  The Academy did some work, as you know, but I want you to be the very best concubine you can!  And that means filling out your dresses, and lingerie, and harnesses juuuuuuust right, you know?”\n\nHer enthusiasm is almost infectious.  As is the way she stares, taking in the sight of you in tight red laminate. \n\n[[“I do… fill things out more, yes.”-&gt;ExamFill]]\n[[“Why is my hair red?-&gt;ExamHair]]",

  "ExamFill": "“You *do*,” Corinth enthuses.  “The Ministry does good work, don’t they?”\n\nLooking down, you have to at least cede that point.  The swell of your chest and hips is more pronounced now, but still natural looking.  For what amounted to surgery on most worlds, there is no evidence of it having occurred mere hours earlier.\n\n“I know it will take some time for you to get used to,” she continues, as your eyes meet again.  “But… you look great, babe.  I know that dress was literally made for you, given how Wardrobes work, but I still mean it when I say you rock it!”\n\n[[“Why is my hair red?-&gt;ExamHair]]\n[[“Can we talk about the dress?-&gt;ExamDress]]",
  "ExamHair": "“I’m a sucker for a red-haired girl,” Corinth states simply, before her trademark smile arises again.  “I mean it!  But I do have another reason.  Did you know red hair isn’t naturally Torean?  Something about their genetics.  Traditionalists don’t care for it, I’ve been told.  Which is also why I chose it.  I’m *not* Torean, neither are you.  Why not flaunt it?”\n\nTwo of the fingers on her hand point towards you, then move in a tight circle.  “And, you know, if I’m going to own a slave I should at least get to pick her hair color!  Just like I picked the dress.”\n\n[[“You adjusted my measurements.”-&gt;ExamFill]]\n[[“Can we talk about the dress?-&gt;ExamDress]]",
  "ExamDress": "The dress in question, rendered wholly in glossy laminate with a longer tail and a deep slit that exposed your thigh readily upon standing certainly was notable.  Corinth takes in the sight as your hands come together upon the table between you, the opera length gloves matching everything else in shade.  Unlike the strangers that surrounded you however, only she could know about the extensive lingerie beneath.\n\n“What do you mean?”  Your Mistress asks.\n\n[[“I just wanted to say that I love it, Corinth!”-&gt;DressLove]]\n[[“Its just not what I expected a slave would wear.-&gt;DressExpect]]\n[[“Actually, can I ask about something else?-&gt;CorDate]]",
  "DressLove": "“I hoped you would!” Corinth replies, reaching across the table to interlock her fingers with your own.  Both of you are gloved, you in red her in black, the colors intermingling.  “I had some of my old clothing, offworld textiles and the like, shipped here while you were at the Academy.  Just in case I needed them.  But you… you will be wearing laminate, only, going forward.  Dresses and bras, corsets and garters… they trained you on heels too, at the Academy?  Right?”\n\n[[“Extensively.-&gt;DressLove2]]",
  "DressExpect": "“Why is that?  Torei has all sorts of slaves, and all sorts of owners.  And there is nothing odd about a favored concubine being taken out on the town, in a glossy dress!  You should count yourself lucky some lichen farmer didn’t buy you, put you in a full enclosure suit all day working their fields.  Although now that I say it, you would probably like that I’m thinking… ah, never mind.  What I mean to say is that I’ll keep you however I like, and I *like* you in this way right now.”\n\nShe pauses to take a sip from her glass, but smiles over the rim before actually drinking.  “And its not the only thing you’re wearing, is it?”\n\n[[“It is not, Mistress!”-&gt;DressExpect2]]\n[[“You mean… the undergarments?”-&gt;DressExpect2]]",
  "DressLove2": "“*Wonderful,*” Corinth gleefully smiles.  “The expectation that a woman, much less a slave, need almost always be heeled was probably the hardest bit for me to adapt to.  My poor toes, those first few weeks and months.  But you know what I’m talking about, and I hope you’d agree that the way it improves one’s posture and the overall look… well, I’ve come to find out it is hard to go wrong with stilettos!”\n\n[[“Its just not what I expected a slave would wear.-&gt;DressExpect]]\n[[“Actually, can I ask about something else?-&gt;CorDate]]",
  "DressExpect2": "She meant the bra and panties beneath, both of which integrated into a two part body harness focused on chest and hips respectfully.  That the Wardrobe had managed such intricacy without breaking the smooth lines of the dress atop them is a testament to Torean engineering.  Likewise, the fact that it had been a recommended addition for “submissive personalities” spoke to just how well Torei knew those who would be wearing such.\n\n“We will get to that,” Corinth promises.\n\n[[“I just wanted to say that I love it, Corinth!”-&gt;DressLove]]\n[[“Actually, can I ask about something else?-&gt;CorDate]]",
  "FeedAsk": "“You most certainly do,” Corinth replies sharply.  “You had better get use to it, babe.  If you’re good perhaps I’ll allow you some proper food, but what you have before you is the standard for most Torean slaves.  Enough nutrition in a single meal to keep you going for the day, and that’s important.  I intend to make sure you keep to a good diet, and good exercise.  I want you as healthy as you can be.”\n\n[[Healthy, but not particularly happy when it came to feeding time it seems.-&gt;CorAskDinner]]",
  "FeedNo": "Corinth’s eyes narrow, not angry but sizing you up.  The black of her brows and the sharp lines of her raven bangs conspire to make it a rather intimidating look.  “Yes you will.”\n\n[[She’s not giving you a choice.-&gt;CorAskDinner]]",
  "Feed1": "Taking up your spoon, you test the proverbial waters by dipping it into the waiting Feed.  Much like porridge or oatmeal it is liquid, but viscous.  Never having looked appetizing, the way your spook slowly slides into the gruel hardly furthers the prospect.\n\nIt certainly doesn’t taste *good*.  Or like much of anything at all.  The lack of flavor is matched to a strange textureless sensation, as if the Feed itself was as glossy and smooth as any piece of laminate clothing.  You’re almost surprised how easily it goes down… and how readily the idea of biting into a proper meal suddenly resonates with you in that moment.\n(set: $Strike to 1)\n[[Still, you take a few more bites.-&gt;CorDate]]",
  "CorDinnerEnd": "“Well, talk about… well, talking!”  Throwing back the last of her drink, Corinth’s enthusiasm boils over with a bright smile.  She stands, sliding from the booth as she offers her hand.  Her other extends towards the rest of Club Lush, the scene below the VIP balcony as always a riotous affair of laminate.\n\n“Can you dance?”  She asks, only to run over your actual answer.  “Although I guess the better question would be if you remember, right?  Don’t worry about it, babe.  Come on, I’ll show you.  Now that we’ve hashed everything out there is so much I’m ready to show you.”\n\n[[Take her hand.  “Show me, Mistress.”-&gt;CorDinnerEnd2]]\n[[Take her hand.  “What do you mean?”-&gt;CorDinnerEndB]]",
  "Feed2": "Digging once more into your food, across the table Corinth finishes her drink.  Tapping in her order on the console between you, another is delivered in short order by a uniformed slave.  You met Cherish months ago, and while this one isn’t her the outfit is the same—as is the Club’s means of compelling them to do good work.  When Corinth presses another button the slave is treated to a bit of vibration from her piercing, her thighs coming reflexively together.\n\nAfterward she thanks Corinth profusely, withdrawing with her tray.  It is a small taste of everyday Torean life, and far more enjoyable than the mouthful of slave feed you have in that moment.\n(set: $Strike to 2)\n[[But you take a few more bites, nearly finishing it.-&gt;CorDate]]",
  "Feed3": "Doing your duty once more, you finish off your so-called meal.  The clink of the spoon upon bowl draws Corinth’s attention away from the distant stage, where a band of some sort is performing.  One of the instruments appears to be a slave’s moans induced to produce a rhythm, but your Mistress’ attention overrides that observation.\n\n“Done,” she notes happily.  “Good.  Shall we wrap things up?  Once you’re ready to go, you need only tell me.  The night is still young, and we *do* have other things to do.”\n(set: $Strike to 3)\n[[Her smile promises so very much.-&gt;CorDate]]",

An armbinder circles your shoulders and holds your arms behind you, rendering you properly helpless, but it is the shipping box&#39;s padding that truly immobilizes you.

A slight tingle is followed by the direct stimulation of your most sensitive of sensual hotspots, and almost immediately you wriggle happily in your bondage.\n\n&quot;I see you&#39;re feeling it,&quot; the Headmistress notes, sounding warm-- a rare tone from the strict authoritarian.  The hand that had been tapping your box now caresses it slowly as she meets your eyes one last time.  &quot;Goodbye, Doll.  Remember you represent Celeste Academy at its best.  Serve Master Tenyon well... and enjoy your new life.  The porters will be here in the morning to collect you.&quot;\n\nAnd with that she leaves, flicking off the light to the room as she goes.  You&#39;re left in darkness, with only your body&#39;s eager sensations to occupy you.  The tight pull of laminate, the strict corset at your waist, the unyielding bondage-- and of course the tickling purr of your stim array, all of it to be maintained throughout your three week trip to your new home.\n\n[[You moan into your gag, happily lost in laminate.-&gt;DollEnd5]]",
  "DollEnd5": "In the morning a pair of men in laminate overhauls come for you.  They look the part of manual labor and soon act like it, working together to heft your box between them.  You vaguely recognize the logo on their gear as being a premier transport company of some sort, which explained how they could employ men on Torei for such work-- it would be as much a matter of prestige and meeting expectations as it is the simple fact that men are so often stronger.\n\nYou can do little beyond rest in your box as they carry you of course, looking up through the lid at the sky above.  In the early light of dawn you still catch glimpses of Grand Aekora&#39;s twinkling skyline in the distance, and beyond that the Way Up itself-- a string of pearls stretching towards infinity.\n\nYou&#39;ve come so far from that troubled woman who had rode down the elevator over a year ago.  The physical aspects are obvious, of course.  At your new Master&#39;s direction you have been improved, made bustier and with more dramatic hips, as well as a host of other alternations.  But the true change is in your thinking, the way you perceive yourself as much as Torei around you.  You&#39;re happy to serve, to be little more than a sexual toy for others, a *Doll* in more than just name.  Struggling allows you to remember little of what life was like before, wearing textiles and working as a prospector-- but simply laying back and obeying your betters brings all manner of delights.  The tight embrace of your laminate and gear is a constant reminder of that, as is the teasing purr of your stim array.\n\n[[You moan quietly.-&gt;DollEnd6]]",

Its so hard now, and you have so little reason to.  Such things get in the way of the sensations, the all encompassing, all consuming ways in which your Isolation Laminate made you feel.  And it is yours now, more than it had ever been.  Somewhere a chronometer ticks over, noting the passage of time, but you merely are aware-- somewhat-- that it has been months since you first entered that mask, this suit.  You need not remove it, you *cannot*.  \n\n**Would you even still want to?**\n\nYou feel a twinge of discomfort at that thought.  A scent is pushed into your mask, something tangy, metallic.

A moan escapes you but is lost to your mask, to the cock inserted down your throat.  You no longer have a gag reflex, a quirk only offworlders had to be cured of anyway.  \n\nAre you being rewarded?  You think so.  Of the others you have not an inkling, and little reason to care.  You were directed here, to converge, in the depths of the Badlands.

Without eyes to see it peers out at a scene utterly foreign to Torei-- lush green foliage, trees and running water.  It stretches out for quite awhile, hills rising in the distance.  *Where are you?*  In that moment you think perhaps you have been transported, brought to some strange new world, but looking to the sky reveals it to be a stark white-- almost artificially so.  Some manner of... biodome, perhaps?  Or perhaps the window was merely a screen, a projection producing a synthetic image.\n\nEither way, neither your leash nor the Daemon pay your interest any mind.

Your side is empty, even the entrance you had used is now gone, but the other side is occupied-- by a Daemon.  Sleek black laminate covers it from head to toe, as always, but this one is reclined in a chair, its arms locked into a straitjacket.  Its legs are spread by padded extensions, while heavy laminate straps scattered about secure it firmly in place.\n\nIt writhes in that bondage, muffled moans escaping it.

Pulling tight, they immobilize you as the door slides back down into place.  Had it not also been built with your measurements in mind it would not have closed, but as it is it almost seems to seal around you completely.  A quiet click is all that announces the door locking shut.\n\nYou do not yet know it, but within your cell you will stay for the next three months, four weeks, and a day-- until somewhere in the vast machinery of thought that was the AI you belong to, a singular logic gate flips over.

The Badlands supported little in the way of life, the great bands of land between equator and poles still low in priority for Mazos and Dahom.  But this village subsisted, clinging like a forgotten flower bud to a rock face that provided shade most of the day.  Its people called it Red Harbor, and therein lay the oddity.  *Harbor* was a wholly foreign word to Torei, a planet without oceans or lakes.  \n\nUndoubtedly one of the founders had brought the word with them during their flight here, along with whatever few implements and tools they had managed to leave with.  For this was a village, a tribe, of runaways-- fleeing the slavery that defined the planet.  A free settlement, if an eternally threatened one.  Mere survival out here could be difficult.  Dust storms capable of ripping a building from its foundations emerged from the pole, raging towards the far off equator.  Thus the rocky shelf that anchored the South of the settlement, providing protection.  That solved one of the major needs, but not the other: *water.*\n\nToreans were born and bred to subsist on far less water than offworlders, but some here had once come from the elevator, and in any case none could do without.  \n\n[[And that is why you stood in the lam-canvas tent of their leader, looking from its raised position down upon the village.-&gt;Dealer3]]",

It must be refilled... but not like this.&quot;\n\nYou turn your laminate covered head, looking down upon her without eyes to truly see.  The terms will not be changed.\n\nThe Chief sighs, pressing her head to the ground in dismay once more before she rises.  At your side she is shorter, your heels give an advantage in height, but strong.  Determined.  &quot;I submit to the terms.&quot;\n\nYou withdraw your hand from the wall as the holographic symbols dissolve, then return your gaze to the window just as the Chief raises her voice to call out.  &quot;Daughter!  Come here, child.&quot;\n\n[[A blonde haired youth turns from her work, and walks your way.-&gt;Dealer4]]",
  "Dealer4": "She is just past her majority, and Badlands bred.  Besides the windswept plateaus and blistering desert, besides Red Harbor, she knew little.  But she knows enough to sink to her knees upon seeing you, worshiped as your kind are by these people.

She coos at the sensation of your all but frictionless fingertips running along her bared skin, tracing her shoulders as you slowly work downwards.  At her waist your hands separate, one hand following the curve of her rear while the other slips around her hips, to the meeting of her tights.\n\n&quot;Please, don&#39;t...&quot; her words are bitten off by an equally pinched moan as you enter her, your fingers working with precision and deft skill.  Gently you guide her towards her Mother&#39;s bed, and is there you keep her, utilizing the hardpoints built into the furniture upon her.  She is without improvement, and could never take the sort of sensations you have been trained to endure, but you do give her a taste.  A tantalizing, yet ever so fleeting demonstration of what your kind could do.\n\nShe climaxes again and again, sometimes pleading for you to stop, other times begging for more.  Eventually its exhaustion that ends her time with you, and its with the coming dawn that you finally rise from her side.  You leave her there, asleep and chained spread-eagle upon the bed, but not before stopping at the roughly hewn table nearby.  There you produce a rectangle of pure black, glossy as your suit, upon which words are embossed.  A Black Card.  An invitation.  An adventure, for it would require the daughter to travel far.  North, across the Badlands, through the lichen farms, into the Ringdoms proper.  To one called Aekora, to a hotel by the name of *Diarch&#39;s Choice...*\n\n[[As you leave Red Harbor, your inserts pulse with rewarding bliss.-&gt;Ending]]",

Your mask already filtered the air, preventing you from inhaling the particulates that swirl in the ruddy haze, but you can feel the cold.  Such storms were as much ice as dust itself, this close to the pole, and your Isolation Laminate did not provide full protection from the discomfort.  It *could*, of course.  You do not doubt that.  It just doesn&#39;t.\n\nOne of the other Daemons is suspended before you upon the rock wall, arms and legs spread.  You rise, having just secured the last restraint around its ankle.  At its side is a 2nd of your obsidian sisters, your instructions having been clear: to lock them here.  You have not questioned, and they submitted immediately.  Why?  That was not yours to know.\n\nInstead you and the other Daemon still free leave, each in a different direction.  Yours is South still, as it has been since you left the equatorial region.

And it truly is *yours*, in a way most Torean laminate could not be claimed.  It had not been printed from a Wardrobe Device, one more blueprint shared throughout the world.  Your Master had ordered this one especially for you, to perfecting measurements, hand-crafted by the Glamoursmiths of Tarekai.  Of course you had not *met* those measurements upon that initial ordering, months ago, but a strict diet and constant exercise had prepared you for this day.  Your day, your Master&#39;s day... your wedding.\n\nIt was an offworlder&#39;s ceremony, in truth, but Master Tenyon hailed from the same stars as you did.  And this would be symbolic.  Just as your union would symbolize the galaxy beyond, as offworlders both, so too would it represent Torei-- by your slavery, and submission.  Thus the fusion ceremony and procedures, and your bare throat.  Reach up, your fingers glide against the bare flesh there.  After so long in a collar, it felt strange to be without a collar.  A very temporary situation, of course, but still.\n\nA knock at the door behind you draws your attention back, and shifting your corset once more you turn.  &quot;Are you... ready, Miss?&quot;\n\nThe voice is that of Jakobs, your Master&#39;s attendant.  He&#39;s a freeman, but the mere fact that your Master kept a male as a servant spoke to his wealth.  It would be Jakobs who would be giving you away.\n\n[[&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;-&gt;WifeEnd4]]",
  "WifeEnd4": "He enters, white chains looped over an outstretched arm, but his attention is on you alone.  &quot;You look... beautiful,&quot; the man concludes, staring openly.  Approaching, he uses his free hand to direct you in a small twirl, getting the full effect of your dress.\n\n&quot;*Very* good,&quot; he notes.  &quot;Although I cannot imagine that corset is comfortable, hmm?  I cannot imagine wearing it for...&quot; he checks the clock on the wall.  &quot;...what will be fourteen hours, or so.  Which does remind me, we should not tarry.&quot;\n\nJakobs shifts the forearm burdened with alabaster restraints.  &quot;Shall I?&quot;\n\n[[&quot;Of course, Sir.&quot;-&gt;WifeEnd5]]",
  "WifeEnd5": "Four cuffs, two for your wrists, two for your biceps.  Guiding your hands behind your back, Jakobs secures them, a bit of time needed to properly align the gleaming chains that crisscross in an intricate pattern between them.  By the time he is done, snapping the final lock closed, your every movement induces a quiet symphony of chains rattling.  \n\n&quot;Come then,&quot; the servant intones, grabbing the bit of chain intended for just such use.  Standing at your side, the leverage it provides allows him to direct you with ease.  His other hand reaches up, moving your veil into place before your face.  The sheer laminate hardly obstructs your features, but represented another offworlder custom.\n\n[[You&#39;re led from your rooms.-&gt;WifeEnd6]]",
  "WifeEnd6": "Much of the preparation that follows is a blur of activity around you.  Slaves and free attendants move quickly through their assorted tasks, but you are required only to wait for your ordained cue.  It comes with a crescendo from the music in the Great Hall of your Master&#39;s estate, and the opening of the doors before you by a pair of liveried slaves.  \n\nJakobs moves immediately, and thus you do as well, his firm hand upon your restraints guiding you forward down the central hall.  The guests that turn to regard you are a veritable who&#39;s who of Arendesh Ringdom&#39;s societal elite, a display of your Master&#39;s prestige and power as grand as the richly furnished Hall itself.  Slaves are spaced along the exterior walls, another demonstration of wealth.\n\nYet despite the grandeur, the majority of your focus is down upon the floor.  Your heels are tall, your dress daring you to forget how restrictive its cut is, threatening to trip at any possible moment.  Jakobs would have caught you, of course, but with all eyes upon you a stumble would have been humiliating.  Unacceptable.\n\nSo you keep your eyes down, submissively, as you&#39;re led up to the dais.\n\n[[Master Tenyon awaits.-&gt;WifeEnd77]]",
  "WifeEnd77": "&lt;img alt=&quot;tenyon&quot; src=&quot;images/npc/tenyon.png&quot;/&gt;\n\nYour owner, your soon to be husband, is only a few years older than yourself.  That surprised many that met with him, but Master Tenyon (who went without a forename in the traditional Arendesh manner) had built his empire upon embracing the unexpected.  A self-made man born on a backwater in the Vawking Cluster, he had come to Torei upon reaching adulthood.  You&#39;ve never heard *why* exactly, but his embrace of Torei&#39;s culture-- and the unique opportunity it provided for a man with ambition-- had been immediate.  \n\nTenyon Imports had been built upon the untapped market deeper within Torei for offworlder goods, which still struggle to disperse far beyond the Way Up itself.  The more antipodal Ringdoms being deeply conservative remained part of the problem, but so too had been a lack of interest from the offworlders themselves.  Torei remained such a fresh frontier, at least when it came to trading, and there was wealth enough for most where it was easy to travel.\n\nBut Master Tenyon had taken risks early, building contacts far from the usual centers of trade.  Today his goods flowed steadily into the heart of the planet, even if it remained somewhat of a trickle compared to the glut that rained down upon the Mountainous Ringdoms.  Still, that success had brought him immense wealth, enough to own hundreds of slaves-- including yourself.\n\nAs you step up upon the dais, Jakobs finally releasing you, and you can seen your Master smiling.  Its slight, that shift of the firm line that is his lips, but there.  His eyes are for you alone, although all of the collected hundreds here are now upon you, drinking you in.\n\n[[You follow the program, and kneel.-&gt;Wife8]]",
  "Wife8": "With your arms still bound, and your dress so demanding, it takes a bit of effort.  But you manage with grace, and your Master begins.  This is not a wedding of equals, after all, and he is not here to accept your hand-- bound as it is.  No, Master Tenyon stands above you to *claim* you, publicly, in the Arendesh and more generally Torean manner.  His speech is not long, nor are you required to speak.  Only to submit, which-- of course-- you do.  \n\nThe collar comes first, rose-gold and seamless.  When he puts it around your neck it is warm, as if he had been holding it to dispel the chill before sliding it into place upon your throat.  His hands are gentle as he does so, but firm.  Next comes the gag, a panel design in white with carefully tailored lace-like designs upon it to match your dress.  Torean bonding ceremonies often thought it proper for a bride to remain silent upon her wedding day, so that she could better consider the new position she found herself in.  And you are no exception.\n\nWhen your Master finally concludes, helping you to your feet, you arise a new woman.  *His* woman, in a manner far beyond that of a mere slave.  You occupy now a position of intense prestige, offworlder in nature but infused so heavily with Torean values as to be something else altogether.  Master Tenyon sat atop a blended court riding a new edge in offworlder-Torean relations, and you will be his most cherished possession therein.\n\n[[And you kiss.-&gt;Wife9]]",
  "Wife9": "His embrace is strong and commanding, but the kiss he places upon the laminate panel covering mouth is gentle.  Your eyes meet and he holds your gaze, even as he sweeps you back, inducing a dramatic pose for the vid-cams that flicker to capture the moment.  Its only when Master Tenyon releases you that you realize you had been holding your breath.\n\nThe rest of the wedding is equally a blur and tribulation.  Still bound and gagged you&#39;re not much of a conversation partner, but your husband keeps you at his side for all that follows.  Introductions and pleasantries with every guest, the reception, the tours of the estate&#39;s gardens late into the night-- hour after hour passes, and you are simply expected to endure, despite the stricture of your dress.  The corset especially proves onerous, its sharp bite leaving you abdomen sore long before fireworks cap the party.\n\nThat left only the final piece to the event: *the bedding.*\n\n[[Reduced to perhaps a dozen, you follow on your leash to the master bedroom.-&gt;Wife10]]",
  "Wife10": "&lt;img alt=&quot;wife&quot; src=&quot;images/npc/wife.png&quot;/&gt;\n\nLed to your wedding bed, you find another woman waiting, her laminate sheer, her full lips pulled into an inviting smirk.  You&#39;re not the only purchase Master Tenyon made from Celeste Academy.  His Doll, and that is the only name he gave her, would of course be participating in any carnal adventure with your Master.  It made sense, her presence demonstrated again for those who now line the bedchamber&#39;s walls your Master&#39;s prestige.  The only thing more expensive than a fully trained Torean slave-wife was a fully trained Academy Doll, after all.\n\nAs Torean tradition demanded your arms remain bound, but you are freed from most of your other garments as you take to the bed.  There you service your new husband and Master for several hours, the small crowd observing your skill and experience as much as his own.  By the coming of dawn you&#39;re left exhausted, as is the Doll, but one final event caps your wedding-- when Master Tenyon fits around your waist his second gift, following that of your collar.\n\nA steel chastity belt.  Unlike the Doll, who could be used by guests, you are your Master&#39;s alone-- and he will be ensuring that fact by keeping you belted at all times.\n\n[[And your first day as a proper Torean slave-wife ends...-&gt;Ending]]",

There is no point of origin, it rides your nerves from toes to throat, inescapable.  You could only avoid it by returning to your feet, which you do, the heavy pack locked to your back shifting uncomfortably as you do.  Upon the HUD of your mask the route you had been working on is projected before you, as well as the familiar command:\n\n*Get to work, Courier #381*\n\nYou take a deep breath and begin walking, both of which prove difficult.  Like every Courier owned by *Full Protocol Couriers*, you wear the traditional uniform couriers engaged in full protocol work have worn on Torei for decades: a fully encapsulating laminate outfit, including a heavy duty opaque mask, and full body harness.  The latter anchored the sealed pack upon your back, spreading out its weight somewhat, while the mask ensured you could travel through any dust storm while also preventing your divulging of your route or packages to anyone, slave or free.  \n\nThe nobility of Torei still disdained technological communication, a lingering holdover from the general fear of the polar AIs, and the lack of available technology before the Way Up.  And thus full protocol couriers, such as yourself, were a popular method of sending important documents and letters in a manner that guaranteed their confidentiality.  Even today, with *glass* devices becoming more widely available, the proper way to sign a business deal or send an invitation remained couriers such as yourself.\n\n[[Few of the nobility care about the woman locked inside your suit, of course.-&gt;CourEnd4]]",
  "CourEnd4": "*Route latency detected.  Deploying motivation.*\n\nThe flashing words upon your HUD push your meandering focus on Torean customs to your route, but you&#39;re not quick enough.  A shock follows, triggered by your implants and piercings, that nearly sends you to your knees.  Your moan is lost to the gag between your teeth, much less the mask however, and achieves little.  Yet a second motivator is provided moments later, your fully regulated oxygen supply suddenly growing sweet as you inhale.  A Torean Aphrodisiac that you&#39;ve come to know well is pumped in, and you have no choice but to breath deeply, your heart fluttering as it burns brightly within your chest.  You want to reach down, to play with yourself, but you know that would only bring about another shock.  So you merely walk on, at the company-standard pace, gritting your teeth in frustration.  Your suit was devious like that, providing a carrot so soon after the proverbial stick.\n\n[[Where were you going again?-&gt;CourEnd5]]",
  "WayUpTravel2": "You flee.  Damn your deal, damn the consequences, damn Torei itself!  The hallways and passages connecting the buildings throughout the downtown provide you an easy enough path to follow, one that did not risk breaking curfew, but you hardly notice.  Your eyes remain forward, checking only the signs that point you onward.  Somewhere along the way you pass Corinth, missing each other in the crowd by mere moments, but your haste overrides everything else.\n\n[[To the Elevator!-&gt;WayUpTravel3]]",
  "WayUpTravel3": "Eventually you arrival at a terminal building that promises free shuttles to the Way Up, operating on constant schedule-- this near the beating heart of Torean commerce, such things never slept.  The trip is undertaken in a blink of your gleaming eyes.\n\nLike a strand of gleaming pearls suspended in the night, the Space Elevator soon stretches before you, disappearing up into the clouds.  On approach via the shuttle, you pass beyond Aekora&#39;s strict borders-- although your fractured memories allow you to piece back together that this wasn&#39;t unusual.  Many of the Ringdoms near the elevator but not directly abutting it had treaties to allow direct lines like the one you&#39;re riding to the elevator base itself.\n\nThat would mean passing through an Aekoran customs checkpoint, the last before entering into the legally distinct area maintained by the Space Elevator authority-- where Torean contracts and slavery no longer applied.  Still-- as the shuttle pulls into port, you need only look up through the glass ceiling above to see your way off Torei so very close.  Can you make it off planet?\n\nThe final customs checkpoint looms ahead of you, words painted above the series of exits making that point clear: EXITING SOVEREIGN TOREAN TERRITORY.  \n\n[[You move towards the line that led to the Way Up itself.-&gt;WayUpTravel4]]",

Presumably the space elevator&#39;s technicians would be preparing for the reverse ascent at that very moment.\n\nStill, to pass through the checkpoint would require an absolutely spotless record.  Anything worthy of arrest would undoubtedly get you pulled aside, to be subjected to the altogether rough mercies of the Ministry of Truants.\n\nThis would be a point of no return, and your very last chance to make for your deal.\n\n[[Enter the line.-&gt;EarlyLeave]]\n[[Turn back for now.-&gt;EarlyLeaveFail]]",

The man flushes a bit then turns, hopping off the rear of the truck in a huff.  You&#39;re left in his wake, alone once more, pleased with yourself.  As a fully trained Doll, you could not turn off that latent sensuality if you tried.\n\nYou&#39;re not given another chance with the man however, as you&#39;re transported from the Academy Campus to begin your trek to your new home and Master.  How would this *Tenyon* be?  You know from your training that he is an offworlder, but very Torean in nature, even having gone as far as to take up Torean naming practices-- apparently the Ringdom in which you would live only utilized a surname for nobility.  Thus Tenyon, with nothing preceding it.\n\nMomentarily your thoughts are interrupted when you&#39;re transferred from sled to the promised train however.  Through your thin-lam window you catch glimpses of passengers boarding, but you and a host of other slaves are instead loaded into the undercarriage-- a dark, humid hold beneath the cars themselves.  Restraints along the floor are utilized on those who are not packed for shipment, while you merely require a few straps to hook your box to the floor.  \n\nEventually the loading is completed and the door closes, leaving you in the inky dark, surrounded only by the sound of other slaves.  Some moan in terror, other ecstasy-- none speak.  Gags are required in slave storage, after all.

The one time your box is actually pulled out, two Truant Officers peering at you, most of your time is spent merely blinking away the blindspots.  But you manage, and apparently pass the customs inspection-- your box is stamped with a mark of inspection, and you&#39;re returned to a train hold.  You&#39;re incapable of telling if it were the same one, but of course you hardly care.  Throughout it all your stim array purrs, and you dream of your mysterious new owner using your waiting holes.\n\nThus three weeks pass, and with that comes your final arrival deep in the antipodes of Torei.  You&#39;re far from the Way Up, carried into a Ringdom few offworlders made the effort to travel to.  Yet your first view of Arendesh Ringdom is perhaps disappointing, if you were expecting some strange alien land-- the Ringdom occupies the same equatorial belt of habitation as Aekora, and thus much of the foliage you see is familiar.  It is far more rural however, lacking the sleek buildings and congested sidewalks of a mountainous Ringdom.  Another transport takes you along winding roads through a massive gate, where you&#39;re then carried into what proves to be an expansive manse.\n\nYou see little of it, of course, given your limited viewport and honest lack of interest in decoration.  But you notice the occasional passing slave, and note with perceptive eyes the occasional hardpoints scattered throughout the home-- small nods allowing for bondage to occur most anywhere.  \n\nEventually you&#39;re deposited in a bedroom, the massive bed frame also quite Torean-- their culture put emphasize on bedroom exploits after all, having an appropriate stage was expected.  There you&#39;re left for several more hours however, alone except for a curious soubrette who looks in on you around noon-- until nightfall.\n\n[[You wake from a drowsy sleep to see a man entering.-&gt;Doll11]]",

The last rays of light are slipping away, and with them the chance for most women to travel, given Aekora&#39;s curfew laws.  But by linking the shops and clubs and bars of downtown Grand Aekora, the local businesses have cleverly avoided that issue-- for walking down the glass lined boulevards allows everyone to remain technically inside.  \n\nWith that extended liberty comes crowds packing most thoroughfares, nearly everyone cloaked in glossy laminate of a thousand different designs and colors.  Even so, with your growing experience you find it quite easy to pick out the offworlders from those Torean-born or trained.  They&#39;re the rare examples of offworld textiles still being used, or gawk at those passing by.  Given the strictness of your bondage its the latter that seem to focus on you most intently, staring as a bit of drool escapes your gags to land upon your laminated breasts.  Native Toreans hardly give you a second glance, merely filing you away as one more slave among so many others being led by her owner.\n\nAnd Isabella does lead, setting a quick pace marked by the harsh snap of her steel-lined stilettos upon the tiled or occasionally paved floors.  She holds her hand down to her side, the loop of your leash twisted around her wrist and gripped by her gloved hand.

To the side a short line awaits, and even a quick glance makes it obvious the clientele trends towards the elite.  The only slaves you see are attending a Mistress or Master.

She wears it so naturally, as if such aggressive sensuality was her natural state, coming as easily as breathing.\n\n&quot;I must underline the fact that I am *quite* pleased you took up my offer, unorthodox as it may have seemed,&quot; your Mistress purrs, meeting your gaze through the mirror.  &quot;What you think about things no longer *needs* to matter, but I am curious if you&#39;re enjoying being reduced... to what you are.  **Mine.**&quot;\n\n[[Nod your head.

  "MeetCherishNNN": "&quot;Strange...&quot; Isabella muses, her eyes twinkling brightly.  &quot;Because I think if I unzipped you right now, and pulled out your front insert, you would drip all over the ground... isn&#39;t that right?&quot;\n\nHer smile is deep with knowing.

Isabella turns her head to regard her, while you see that she is uniformed-- in tight laminate.  Surrounded by the violet hues of the club, her servant&#39;s livery matches nicely in it&#39;s light shade of blue, being tight across her chest before expanding to a very short skirt.  Just how short it is she demonstrates by lifting it for you while bowing.  You recognize it from your time with Isabella as a very well practiced Torean reverence.\n\n&quot;I saw you observing yourself in the mirror,&quot; she explains, speaking to Isabella alone as she smooths out her skirt and petticoats, &quot;and I just had to say it, Mistress.  You wear laminate well, as does your slave.  Ah, but where are my manners?  Allow me to welcome you to Club Lush, my name is Cherish.  As a slave of this establishment, please allow me to service you in whatever manner you deem me capable of.&quot;\n\nHer collar is thin, pulled tight against her throat, fashionable-- and without an observable way for it to be removed.\n\n&quot;Tell me of your services,&quot; Isabella commands.\n\n[[And Cherish obeys.-&gt;MeetCIsa4]]",
  "MeetCIsa4": "&quot;First time at Lush?&quot;  She winks.  &quot;No problem, Mistress.  Let me run you through the various services we offer here, alright?&quot;\n\nShe steps more directly to Isabella&#39;s side, allowing her white gloved hand to be more easily followed as she uses it to direct both your gazes.  &quot;Most of our guests start at the bar, which is fully stocked with a range of drinks-- both alcoholic and otherwise-- sourced from all over Torei, as well as a selection imported from the Offworlders.  Or if you like, you may take a seat at a table or booth.  Built into each is a button you can use to call the nearest available slave at your convenience, as well as to reward or punish us as you deem necessary.&quot;\n\nJust what *that* meant isn&#39;t clear, as Cherish turns you towards the mouth of a hallway that disappears into darkness-- a bright pink neon sign above shaped like a pillow.  &quot;We also provide several private rooms, outfitted with lounging areas and bed, rented by the hour.  Many freewombs utilize them to solicit their betters, but for the right price you can also rent me-- or any of the other slaves in-uniform for the night, if you like.&quot;  Another wink.  &quot;Restraints included, of course.&quot;\n\nFinally she casts her attention upward, to the second story balcony overlooking the stage.  &quot;And that would be our VIP area.  Invitations are *quite* hard for most to come by, but I have been made aware that you are a Naram-Sin, Mistress?  If you wish, it would be my pleasure to seat you there immediately.&quot;\n\nIsabella glances about, then produces your identification card.  The SLAVE stamp along the top still looks fresh.  &quot;First things first, I believe there is someone here expecting my slave.  You will tell me if this is true.\n\n[[Cherish takes the card.-&gt;MeetCIsa5]]",
  "MeetCIsa5": "&quot;Ah, of course!  If I could borrow the identification card, I can check to see where your party is waiting?  I just need to stop at the bar, I will be right back.&quot;\n\nTaking your card, Cherish moves just as indicated, allowing you to watch her go.  Her swaying hips shift her skirt just *so*, revealing the triple hints of white that are her panties, petticoats, and garters.  You note Isabella watching just as much as you do.  At Cherish&#39;s return, however, you sense an incoming problem.\n\n&quot;Mistress,&quot; she begins, &quot;the good news is that we did have your name on record.  Your party is waiting in our VIP Suite #4... but they did not provide authorization for you to ascend, and have an outstanding do-not-disturb order.  Obviously you are freely invited to enter our VIP area at your will, but you will need to make contact yourself.&quot;\n\nIsabella nods, sliding your ID back into her purse.  &quot;Very good.  One more thing, slave.  Where is the Sargon in attendance tonight?&quot;\n\n[[Cherish tenses up just a bit.-&gt;MeetCIsa6]]",
  "MeetCIsa6": "The serving girl adjusts her glasses, Torean biomedical prowess meaning they *had* to just be for decoration.  Then she first indicates a woman seated primly at one of the private booths along the wall.

She is a scholar of some sort, as I--&quot;\n\n&quot;A scholar of *Daemons*,&quot; Isabella interrupts with a frown.  &quot;I am well aware.&quot;\n\nCherish takes the interruption in stride, but her tone shifts to worry.  &quot;Then I would hope, Mistress, that you&#39;re aware that Club Lush certainly wishes no incidents between the ruling families of our Ringdom to occur beneath its roof?  My Master is on good terms with both House Sargon and House Naram-Sin.&quot;\n\nIsabella waves away her concern without a second thought.  &quot;It is none of your concern, slave, but you needn&#39;t worry.&quot;\n\nTugging on your leash, your Mistress leads you directly towards the seated Sargon.  \n\n[[You are forced to follow.-&gt;Sargon1]]",
  "Sargon1": "&lt;img alt=&quot;tysus&quot; src=&quot;images/npc/tysus.jpg&quot;/&gt;\n\nFrom the vantage of your approach, you get your first good look at Tysus Sargon.  She&#39;s seated alone in the center of a crescent-shaped booth, the plush dark material drinking in the light of the club.  She would have been all but invisible had she not been focused on a haptic display projected before her, massive data tables running down before her as she leans in, adjusting black-rimmed glasses.\n(set: $Isasked to false)\nAs should have perhaps been expected, her outfit is pure laminate, the strictly business look of her pencil skirt offset by the semi-transparent material of the shirt she wears, the front pulled open exposing the bra worn underneath.  That mixture of serious scholarship and playful sensuality seems to define her, from the outfit to her hair, black strands pulled into a tight bun-- but offset, producing an appeal asymmetrical effect.\n\nAt that moment she holds a stylus in her hand, tapping it gently against blood-red lips.  There is absolutely no doubt in your mind that she had failed to notice Isabella&#39;s approach, which could only mean she was ignoring you both deliberately.  Unwilling to play any such game, Isabella seats herself at the table without invitation.

But what can she do now?\n\n&quot;Oh, this is *delightful.*&quot;  Reaching for your leash, she quickly ties the side usually used for holding to Isabella&#39;s collar than grabs the space between.  Given the length of the laminate cord you&#39;re drawn together, shoulder to shoulder, where Isabella finally looks to you.  There is anger there, burning as strong as the cinnamon cigarettes she favored, but something else too.  *Disappointment.*  She put her trust in you, and you have failed her.  Just what that meant is quickly established by Tysus, who looks between you almost giddy with excitement.  \n\n&quot;I suppose we can toss the rest of that horrid original plan.

Despite herself, and to her evident frustration, Isabella joins you in moaning openly to the fondling.  For a brief moment you can imagine Tysus guiding you and Isabella towards climax, but that fantasy is broken as the Sargon suddenly steps away.\n\nShe doesn&#39;t go far, merely to the couch where (if: $Brief is true)[she once more opens her briefcase](else: )[withdraws a briefcase from beneath and opens it].

  "Fail3": "Fighting, begging, pleading-- it matters not to Tysus.  With you in tow, and all but dragging Isabella, she leads you from her suite and back into the hallway.  There isn&#39;t even hope for someone to see you, to come to your rescue-- collared and dressed in slave gear, no proper Torean would think twice about a Mistress treating you harshly.  \n\nNor is your destination far.  Moving two doors down takes a bit, given Isabella&#39;s growled resistance, but Tysus is just as stubborn-- and has the advantage of usable arms and leverage.  Eventually she manages to push you and your Mistress up against the wall beside the door to Suite #4, holding you there as she knocks upon the door.  Once, twice-- and when that does fail with the toe of her heeled boot, inducing *quite* a racket.\n\nThe door opens suddenly in response, revealing a bespectacled young man looking more than a little harried.  &quot;Ah, you&#39;re-- wait.  You&#39;re not she.  I&#39;m sorry, you must have the wrong--&quot;\n\n&quot;A Daemon-Worshipper?&quot;  Tysus interrupts, leaning in.  Her words clearly spark panic in the young man, who holds up his hands, shaking his head.\n\n&quot;Of course not, I&#39;m just staying here for--&quot;\n\nPushing her way past him and into the room, Tysus maintains her hold on your leash, thus pulling you both along.

  "Fail4": "&quot;Slaves,&quot; Tysus intervenes, pulling sharply upon your leash.  You and Isabella are brought together by the maneuver, chest to chest, where you can see the alarm in her eyes.  The Sargon controlling you both watches you both closely, even as she addresses the man again.  &quot;One of them, I presume, you gaze a Black Card to?  They both have come to answer it.&quot;\n\nThat *does* seem to calm the man a bit, although he never shakes that lingering look of prey being hunted.  His attire is laminate, a smart suitcoat and tailored trousers rendered in dark grey.  His tie is undone however, a bit of dishevelment shared by the antechamber you&#39;ve entered into.  Much like Tysus&#39; suite, this one features two doors leading off, although the one to the bedroom is closed.  \n\nIts Tysus that notices a suitcase near the door however, the entire front opened to reveal a set of restraints, clearly positioned for someone to be folded up and locked within.  &quot;Ah,&quot; she notes.  &quot;Clever.  I was wondering how you got it into the Club without my seeing, or without the management throwing you out for that matter.  You *do* have some pact with the AIs.&quot;\n\nThe man eyes her carefully, adjusting his glasses.  &quot;You certainly... know a lot about how this sort of thing is done... you are...?&quot;\n\n&quot;No,&quot; Tysus replies sharply.  &quot;I do not worship Daemons, I am here merely to deliver the girl you were waiting for-- alongside a bonus.  Which perhaps we will need to discuss afterward, I may not work with the AI but I would be interested in a reward for... this gift I give them.&quot;\n\n&quot;They can be most generous!&quot;  The man enthuses, glad to be on the same page.  &quot;If you would just lead them to the door?&quot;\n\n[[He indicates the bedroom, which Tysus strides towards immediately.

  "Fail5": "&lt;img alt=&quot;daemon&quot; src=&quot;images/npc/daemon.jpg&quot;/&gt;\n\nThe Daemon, the Emissary, waits for you in the center of the room.  (if: $Daemon is true)[You saw it before, in that alleyway back on the streets, and its much the same as you had glimpsed there.] Its body is uniformly covered in black laminate, stripping it of any individuality or sense of self.  There is no discernible face, only the glossy material remains, stretched so tightly across a male frame as evidenced by narrow hips and wide shoulders. Even so that masculinity is *intense*, as if the Daemon condensed it, adding potency as everything else was stripped away.  In that wake of simplified existence you feel your own curvaceous body all the more readily.  The swell of your breasts, the smooth run from hip to waist, your pert rear-- the other side of the Daemon&#39;s equation.\n\nIt reaches out its hand, and in quiet awe Tysus hands over your shared leash with Isabella.  The Daemon&#39;s grip is firm, and far stronger than you had anticipated.  It demands your full attention but does not abuse it, instead simply leading you over to the bed where two distinct sets of gear lay upon it.\n\nTwo suits.  Black as a night without stars, yet so very reflective, promising to fill that void with sources of light all its own.  Smooth.  Glossy.  Featureless and all-consuming.  And yet... *familiar*.  Standing there before them, it takes you awhile, but you recognize it in the one on the left.  That... was no ordinary suit.  This was *your* isolation suit.  Careful measurement could have confirmed it, but your gut reaction is more then enough, akin to looking into a mirror.  A mirror just like that one you awoke to this morning in that hotel, a mirror you gaze into deeply, seeing not your own reflection but something... else.  A shadow of pleasure and ecstasy.\n\nThe male lifts the helmet of that one, split into two portions yet lacking any hint of a seam.  Within you see the impression of a face-- your face.  \n\n[[And with it comes recollection.-&gt;Fail6]]",
  "Fail6": "There were never material riches in this deal, and this isn&#39;t your first time on Torei.  As Corinth had suggested, you had come to this planet once, then twice, then again and again-- utterly enthralled by its possibilities.  But you had never indulged, Corinth and the hotel worker had made that clear as well.  An odd mixture of intrigue and restraint, perhaps that was what had drawn them to you.  The polar AIs, through their Daemon, with an offer you came to fear you would not-- could not-- refuse.  \n\nThus the Mem-Burn, the self-bondage.  A last desperate attempt to run out the clock, to force the missing of this rendezvous and drive you once more to the Way Up, this time without reason to return.  But you had underestimated Torei and its denizens, the will that had driven you to this point now subjugated entirely. You no longer have the means to accept a deal.  It would instead be forced upon you and Isabella both, as had been done to slaves on Torei again and again...\n\n[[The helmet is yours, forever...-&gt;Fail7]]",

Slowly, ever so slowly, it brings it up towards your waiting face.  How could it this easy, to lose everything?  But it is.  Damn it all, it&#39;s as easy as pressing the helmet to your face.  Closer and closer, until finally-- with glorious finality, you feel the impossibly soft laminate of the AI&#39;s construction for the very first time.  It envelopes your lips, your nose, your chin-- then your entire head in its cool embrace.  You&#39;re blinded, gagged, deaf, helpless, even as you feel the Daemon moving the back portion into place to complete the seal.\n\nAfterward he presses against you, masculinity and femininity joining in rapturous union that takes the form of a simple embrace.  Even this first experience feels so strange, so wonderful, so terrifying-- and its only just begun.  You barely hear Isabella struggling to escape sometime later, her failure, her own  mask being applied...\n(set: $Ending to 1)\n[[It feels so good...-&gt;Fail8]]",

You&#39;re not sure if the straitjacket you wear is the one you entered the room with, or an alteration made by the power that now compels you on a whim.  But it holds you tightly beside your fellow Daemon, who even now you can only vaguely remember had been Isabella.  You both wriggle through the pleasure cycles.\n\nYou lost count of your orgasms somewhere in the twenties, and that had been hours ago when it had directed you to the bed.  Now you&#39;re utterly lost to the rapture, to its pleasure.  Sometimes you and Isabella are allowed to couple, grinding your smooth laminate cunts against each other, but not always.  Sometimes the male joins you.  Sometimes it just commands you to sit through the next orgasm.  You&#39;re not sure why.  It&#39;s not your concern.

Already you cannot imagine it, but look upon it like a nightmare, horrific and unreal.  Only the shame remains, and that grows dimmer with each sensation that emanates from your tortured, rapturous cunt.  The thought of your womanhood sends your mind downward, playing across your encapsulated breasts, down along your strictly corseted waist, to the meeting of your thighs.  You cannot play with yourself even if you weren&#39;t bound, *They* have already claimed you, but the suit rewards your considered promiscuity nevertheless.  Pleasure atop pleasure.  \n\n[[Writhing, moaning, you cum again.-&gt;Fail9]]",
  "Fail9": "Your last glimpse of Tysus Sargon is her standing over you as you lad upon your back.  The Daemon that had been Isabella straddles your head, pressing her cunt against your glossy mask, while below the male drives his obsidian shaft into your cunt.  All three of you are synced, cumming in glorious union, but it is Tysus who looks the most pleased.  She had won, after all.  And even came out further ahead than she had intended.  Nevertheless you barely notice her leaving, as you shift positions to rub your own mask against the male&#39;s member.  \n\nUnderstanding had come to you slowly, but They had made it clear.  That lingering shame you wrestled with, at having lead yourself to this fate, it could be so easily done away with.  If you admitted to *yourself* you could not control what was happening to you, there would be no guilt.  Just pleasure.  Always pleasure.  You cum again, arching your back, feeling the suit sucking on your nipples, draining some liquid down your throat.  The details didn&#39;t matter, not when you could be cumming again.\n\nBut instead They ask you to rise, and you do.  Why wouldn&#39;t you?  The male awaits, perhaps he had been beside the bed this entire time.  Of Isabella there is no sign.  Had she already left?  Another thing that doesn&#39;t matter.  He presses his hand against your sealed cunt, claiming it.  But it was not him, it was Them.  Just as your hand against his bulge is not your own, its their will-- you just obey.  Together you submit, as you always will.  \n\nYou emerge out into daylight, the warmth of it upon your obsidian skin so very wonderful.  Where are you?  It doesn&#39;t matter.  What are you doing?

The base of her outfit is now constituted by a black catsuit, but her every liberty is as restrained as your own.  From the pair of gags, ring and cock, seated in her mouth to the collar at her throat, from the bolero straitjacket holding her arms beneath her breasts to the way her hips shift with the obvious signs of plugs being installed, you recognize in that moment just how quickly Torei&#39;s laminate embrace could turn on a person.  Tysus has been installed within a slave suit, her own plotting have backfired spectacularly.\n\n&quot;Oh, now *this* is a treat,&quot; Isabella breaths, her tone like laminate itself: smooth and alluring, but backed with all manner of sensual promises.  Tysus is clearly less amused, her eyes shooting your Mistress daggers, but her struggling is clearly achieving little.  In fact she almost topples herself, but Isabella is quickly to steady her, even as she gives you another glance.\n\n&quot;I would suspect this particular outfit choice is hers, but reversing it upon her is quite inspired.  Very good, my slave.  Now...&quot; she turns, still guiding Tysus with hands upon her shoulders.  Talking as she walks, you follow dutifully.\n\n&quot;Do not look so cross with me, Tysus,&quot; she all but purrs.  &quot;There is nothing more dangerous than the game our families play, after all, and I do think you underestimated my new pawn.&quot;\n\nCrossing the antechamber back into the bedroom, she lines you up shoulder to shoulder with Tysus-- before forcibly pushing you both down upon the massive bed.\n\n[[Your happy moan is matched with the Sargon&#39;s grunt of fear.-&gt;TaskPass3]]",

To her cyclonic discontent you are quite calm however, having grown accustomed to Isabella&#39;s forceful nature, and the sensation of helplessness.  To most Torean slaves you would still be a novice in most things, of course, but compared to the fallen Mistress you&#39;re a veritable expert.  And you sense that difference will soon be made apparent as Isabella looks down on you both, a gloved finger held to her lips in thought.\n\n&quot;Obviously we will *not* be utilizing the plan we discussed earlier.&quot;  Her crimson lips hold a smirk between each spoken word, although without her mirrored glasses she does seem a *bit* more approachable.  As approachable as a fully empowered Torean dominatrix could be.  Continuing, she moves back and forth, as if considering alternatives-- even though you know her well enough to recognize a decision has already been made.\n\n&quot;I suspect you will not give me the passcode to your glass?&quot;  Isabella&#39;s question is met with an immediate shake of Tysus&#39; head, her anger having been stoked enough to rise to such a direct challenge.  Even so, your Mistress clearly had expected it.\n\n&quot;As you will.  I am certain I will be able to convince you, Tysus.  I am *quite* experienced with getting what I want from someone in a uniform such as that.&quot; Her teeth are white, you almost imagine her fanged, a predator smiling over dinner.  Being on the menu somehow pleases you.  &quot;And it just so happens my new slave has performed admirably today.  Enough to earn a reward.

I will presume the same of the rest of your body.  You will use Tysus for your pleasure, however you can manage.

Her eyes speak to anxiety, and quite a bit of indignation at being used in such a manner.  Such concerns are pushed from your mind completely.  Your Mistress, the one who&#39;s pendent hung from your collar, had given you a command.\n\nHow will you follow it?\n\n[[Wriggle closer to Tysus, try to press your gag to her.-&gt;Task5Gag]]\n[[Roll over and mount her, at the hips.-&gt;Task5]]\n[[Roll over and mount her, at her head.-&gt;Task5Head]]",

Again obsidian laminate meets its counterpart upon the Sargon, but while you provide a sensual gagged kiss she remains distant.

The material of your suits was designed for that, of course, being as slick to the touch of other laminate as anything else-- a mild protection against slaves pleasing themselves too easily.  And you would in fact have achieved little, were it not for the way the base of your plugs press against Tysus&#39;.\n\nShe clearly feels it too, her eyes widening, her head lifting from the bed as she tries to say something.  It emerges as little more than a moan however, one that you join in, looking down upon her with amusement.

Lowering yourself you press your zippered cunt, forbidden to you by lock and key, against the equally smooth laminate of her mask.

Apparently she had little time to explain to the catgirl, if such a creature would even make the effort to understand, and instead merely deploys a small controller against her.

The more antipodal Ringdoms being deeply conservative remained part of the problem, but so too had been a lack of interest from the offworlders themselves.  Torei remained such a fresh frontier, at least when it came to trading, and there was wealth enough for most where it was easy to travel.\n\nBut Master Tenyon had taken risks early, building contacts far from the usual centers of trade.  Today his goods flowed steadily into the heart of the planet, even if it remained somewhat of a trickle compared to the glut that rained down upon the Mountainous Ringdoms.

The first chain Petros produces is attached to the back of her collar, linking it with a hardpoint at the top of the pole-- just as the slave girl was restrained.  He goes further however by then forcing her booted feet up, further and further until they press against the backs of her thighs.  There he links them, keeping them in place, allowing Euphoria only her knees themselves upon which to balance.  She wriggles afterward, her full breasts shifting lewdly atop her corset, but can neither take her weight from her knees nor fall over-- a position you quickly recognize as agonizing.  Even so, your elder Sister seems to be smiling around her gag, beneath her muzzle.\n\n[[And you&#39;re next.-&gt;Nun12]]",
  "Nun12": "The process is repeated upon your slighter form.  Back to the pole, leashed, arms around it, legs forced up and behind your thighs.  In mere moments you&#39;re kneeling in pain, back curved and breasts pushed out as you wriggle just as intently as Euphoria, fighting in vain for a position that would give you comfort.  Upon the harsh concrete your knees complain of taking your whole weight, and the way your arms are wrenched back and secured around the pole induce a burning in your shoulders.  A final addition comes in the way Petros tightens the straps of your corset that ran between your legs, squeezing another half inch from them, the grinding sensation of the thick laminate running to each side of your womanhood damnably close to providing a teasing sensation.\n\nYou moan in response but Petros ignores you, instead standing.  He had explained himself once and makes no effort to do so again, but merely turns towards the terminal cafe.  The door clicking closed is the final announcement of his dismissal, while you are left behind on a public street, bound and gagged.  At your side Euphoria arches her back just a bit further, fully presenting herself, while the slave bound to your other side merely stares warily.\n\n[[Present yourself eagerly, as your Sister demonstrates.-&gt;Nun13Present]]\n[[Struggle in your bondage!-&gt;Nun13Strug]]\n[[Try to use the straps between your legs for pleasure.-&gt;Nun13Please]]",

Head lifted to demonstrate your veiled nature, back curved alluringly, emphasizing bust and rear, and of course legs spread willingly.  All of it forces you against your restraints, but not in a manner that sought escape-- just the opposite in fact.  The added discomfort is merely a byproduct of your submission, seeking out every facet of liberty left to you so as to better recognize that you are well and truly bound.\n\nAnd it is not long before you draw attention. The slave-suited woman to your side had been there longer, but her sort were common enough-- several pass by, a few leashed, others undoubtedly running errands for their owners.  But your uniform is unique, excepting Euphoria&#39;s at your side of course, and its ritual complexity quickly draws interest.

  "Nun16": "The woman disappears into the crowd, and proves to be bolder than most.  Others pause to stare at you and Euphoria, and occasionally the third girl wearing a slave suit, but none approach you.  What had been a novel experience starts to grow stale, especially as your body begins to protest at the strict bondage, yet your escort and temporary Master still doesn&#39;t emerge.  \n\nYou find yourself growing increasingly aroused, despite your best efforts.  Exactly *why* is harder to pinpoint.  Perhaps it was your uniform, the smooth embrace of your layers of laminate.  Or your bondage, the sensation of helplessness growing alongside your discomfort, unable to free yourself.  Or perhaps you simply liked being on display, left outside a shop like a bothersome pet.  Certainly the leash hooked to the rear of your collar helped reinforce that.\n\nThe third slave&#39;s owner eventually returns, unhooking her before reapplying a leash and leading her away.  You&#39;re not spared much of a glance, and Euphoria at least doesn&#39;t seem bothered-- she retains her strict posture and position, readily showcasing her impressive curves for everyone who passes.\n\n[[An hour eventually slips by.-&gt;Nun17]]",
  "Nun17": "Finally your Master returns.  Petros emerges from the terminal cafe much as he had entered, without much apparent concern for your situation.  He does address you immediately however, checking you over, asking quickly if you had been bothered.  Clearly he didn&#39;t think embarrassment and molestation counted as &#39;bothered&#39; however, and in short order he&#39;s unchaining you.  Euphoria is treated first, the hierarchy of slaves respected, but soon you too are allowed to stand.\n\nTo your surprise your muscles protest a bit, lingering pain in your thighs especially burning brightly.  Petros clearly notes your discomfort as he hooks your collar back into place, although his masked visage suggests little sympathy.  His tone is none the better.\n\n&quot;A few weeks collared, and you will get used to it.&quot;  His words seem to suggest the truth, gauging by Euphoria.

  "Nun18": "Your Master, as always, sets a harsh pace.  By the time Petros finally stops some twenty minutes later you&#39;re breathing heavily through your nose, the heavy steel ring through your septum having proven bothersome.

Nearby lights enter them only to refract, spilling out in bright patterns.  It&#39;s enough to distract you momentarily from a choice that presents itself-- but eventually you focus on your immediate concerns.\n\nNot only is the club ornate, it&#39;s guarded by a bouncer, a testament to the Club&#39;s wealth demonstrated by the fact that he&#39;s male.  To the side a short line awaits, and even a quick glance makes it obvious the clientele trends towards the elite.  The only slaves you see are attending a Mistress or Master.  Getting in that way could be pricey.\n\nPetros of course makes that way immediately, dragging you along behind.\n\n[[Those in line glare as you and your escort skip to the front.-&gt;Nun19]]",
  "Nun19": "To your surprise the bouncer doesn&#39;t immediately demand you return to the back of the line, and instead looks Petros up and down.  A moment passes, then two.\n\n&quot;Master Petros, how good of you to join us this evening.&quot;  Reaching to his side, he pushes the door open, then finally turns his attention to you and Euphoria.  &quot;Two Sisters of the Order too?  Oblations?&quot;\n\nPetros shakes his head.  &quot;Their business is their own.&quot;\n\n&quot;Shame, as you know the owner always appreciates when the Order provides free services.&quot;  Gesturing for your small party to pass, he reaches to your rear as you pass, fondling you briefly through the slick laminate of your uniform.\n\n[[Sound indignant!  &quot;Mmmgh!&quot;-&gt;Nun20A]]\n[[Mewl happily.  &quot;Mmmgh...&quot;-&gt;Nun20B]]",

Petros turns his head to regard her, while you see that she is uniformed-- in tight laminate.  Surrounded by the violet hues of the club, her servant&#39;s livery matches nicely in it&#39;s light shade of blue, being tight across her chest before expanding to a very short skirt.  Just how short it is she demonstrates by lifting it for you while bowing.  You recognize it as that peculiar Torean practice, a very well practiced Torean reverence.\n\n&quot;Allow me to welcome you to Club Lush, my name is Cherish.

Moving to Euphoria, he pulls down her muzzle momentarily, allowing him to remove her gag, but leaves the panel of laminate down.

Tossing the gag aside, he leaves you momentarily incapable of speech-- your thoughts were not necessary.\n\n&quot;Thus comes your remittance,&quot; he says with his strange drawl.  &quot;You will pay as a woman should, with her body?&quot;\n\n&quot;Of course,&quot; Euphoria replies, her gloved hands twisting a bit in their restrained position behind her.  &quot;Would you be willing to assist us in accessing the VIP section?  We would of course compensate you further.&quot;\n\nThe Master shakes his head.  &quot;I dislike the VIP area, it is quiet and demure.  I do not come to Lush for this.  And besides, you have no legitimate business in such an area, as slaves.&quot;\n\n&quot;As you say,&quot; Euphoria nods, her habit emphasizing the movement.  &quot;But there is a matter we must address, regardless.&quot;\n\n&quot;Then you will need to find some other means of access,&quot; the man replies simply.  &quot;I will hear no more of it.  I would make use of your holes.&quot;\n\nEuphoria nods again, taking his refusal in stride.  &quot;I have only the one of course, but we are slaves, and willing to serve.

Your continued stillness seems a proper middle road between reluctance likely to draw his ire, and an eagerness that would have been undignified.\n\nHis hands move again, fondling your breasts.  The bottom-most layer of your uniform, the catsuit, is well tailored, the breast cups that held your chest providing as much lift and support as they do display.  As his fingers find your nipples Petros pauses, gently kneading them between forefinger and thumb.  Your body instantly reacts, nipples growing hard.  It a reaction he seems pleased with, his mask nodding as he stands back up to his full height.\n\n&quot;Once you are graced with the Vow of Uniformity, as your elder Sister has, you will be capable of presenting Torean perfection.&quot;  He tweaks Euphoria&#39;s own nipples, their piercings standing out as she coos softly, spurring him on.

He wins in that moment, looking back to you.\n\n&quot;But you *are* pleasing now, on your knees, as a woman should be.  Not like an offworlder slut who does not truly understand.  This is why I give so freely to your Order-- seeing women like you made into *this* pleases me greatly.&quot;\n\nHis magnanimity peaks, and with a gesture he indicates his rigid cock, the laminate pulled tightly around it gleaming.  &quot;Your Sister suggested you should follow her lead, but I would like to see what you can manage yourself.

Fully engorged, he enters your mouth slowly-- the smooth laminate that covers his shaft feeling almost slippery against your waiting tongue.  You had seen the size of his manhood, but it&#39;s another experience entirely to have it pressed entirely into your mouth.  Inch by inch, his pelvis only finally hilts against your lips *just* as you feel on the verge of choking.\n\nEuphoria meanwhile augments the experience by leaning in, her red eyes gleaming as she suckles upon his balls, her tongue rolling out slowly to tease and play.\n\n[[Pull your head back.-&gt;Nun28Fail]]\n[[Suck gently on his member.-&gt;Nun28Suck]]\n[[Look up and moan happily.-&gt;Nun28Moan]]",

He seemed a particularly conservative sort, even by Torean standards-- perhaps that explained his fascination with your technique.

The Wardrobe Device before you looks a bit different then the one you encountered at the Hotel this morning, but the *glass* display built into the front is running on the same operating system from before.  \n\nThere are also several cases stacked to the side of the room, their exteriors either a particularly shiny plastic or (more likely) a utilitarian form of laminate.  \n\n(if: $Belted is false)[[[Approach the Wardrobe Device.-&gt;NBRWardrobe2]]](else: )[Already locked into chastity, you have no more use for the Wardrobe.]\n[[Examine the cases.-&gt;NBRCases]]\n[[Return to the previous room.-&gt;NBRSlaves]]",
  "NBRLounge": "Passing through the door marked SLAVE LOUNGE, you enter into what you quickly determine to be the actual living quarters of Lush&#39;s slaves.  It&#39;s remarkably well furnished, the rather large room having tall vaulted ceilings, a small balcony atop centered on what appeared to be a fireplace of sorts.  Vid-screens and comfortable looking couches occupy the lower floor, along with a kitchenette, separated by an island-like counter of considerable length.\n\nThankfully the room remains unoccupied, for the time being at least.\n\n[[Return the way you came.-&gt;NBRSlaves]]\n[[Check out the fire pit on the overlook.-&gt;NBRLoungeFire]]\n[[Check out the kitchen area.-&gt;NBRLoungeKitchen]]\n[[Check out the area near the vid-screens.-&gt;NBRLoungeScreens]]",

These have to be the manner in which Club Lush kept its slaves at night, you imagine, a handful of personal accoutrements decorating each-- alongside a name.  Third on your left, you notice Cherish&#39;s cell.\n\nThe sounds you had heard are louder here, and its in the furthest cell you see someone moving-- a form of red and black laminate, wriggling to the sound of lurid moans atop the bed which she is strapped to.  \n\nThe name on the cell is *Akrai*, and above her stands Euphoria, hands clasped in prayer.\n\n[[Approach them.-&gt;NBRAkrai]]\n[[Return the way you came.-&gt;NBRSlaves]]",

Before you can even begin reading the fine print below, however, the screen flashes with an override warning and the device itself unlocks for you-- clearly the Club&#39;s owner had sent ahead his credentials.\n\nA splash of color slides across the screen, and with it comes unbridled access to the Wardrobe Device.  Unlike the machine you utilized at the hotel, this one appears to have full access to a potential inventory of outfits several thousand pages long.  You may have harbored a desire to explore them at length, but a vow of poverty prevented you from purchasing any of them-- besides that which the data chit you hold would allow of course.

On the back and framing the peephole opening built into the chest are Club Lush&#39;s logo.\n\nYou conclude this must one of the relatively rare cases where the Wardrobe Device nearby couldn&#39;t easily recreate the outfit, probably due to the particular brightness of the laminate, and as such had been crafted in a more traditional manner and then shipped in.  \n\n[[Search through another of the cases.-&gt;NBRCase2]]\n[[Step back from the cases.-&gt;NBRWardrobe]]",

Flipping through several pages reveals an examination of upcoming fashion lines, the current fad being based around exclusivity.   Instead of being freely available from Wardrobe devices, it appears most of the current designs must be special ordered preformed.\n\nAn interesting read, but of little use to you otherwise.\n\n[[Step back.-&gt;NBRLoungeFire]]",

  "NBRTVSports": "You flip to a sports channel, only to find a particularly archaic sport being practiced: chariot racing.  It takes a moment, but with a bit of shock you finally realize what made it so very Torean.  Instead of horses, or other creatures of burden, each chariot is instead pulled by a team of six women-- ponygirls-- each team of them wearing the same brightly colored laminate beneath their tack and harness.  Given the cloven heels each are wearing you&#39;re surprised to see them maintaining a full sprint easily, although the way their drivers lash them mercilessly from on high explains their motivation.  \n\nAs you watch a team crosses the finish line, breaking a laminate band stretched across the field.  They&#39;re met with furious applause and cheering from the stands as the camera rushes towards the driver for what soon becomes a post-race interview.

  "NBRTVLongwave": "Unlike the other channels, which come in with perfect clarity, this one struggles a bit with an absolutely ancient issue: static.  Given the reference to longwave, you conclude this particular channel has to be coming in from far away, perhaps bounced off the atmosphere from the other side of the planet.\n\nIf the channel itself is ancient, the program playing is almost beyond time itself.  It appears to document a mother and daughter&#39;s fictionalized life on a homestead in what&#39;s referred to as the &#39;Lichen Belt&#39;, an area depicted as mostly desolate.  What&#39;s most shocking however are the slaves, many included in the background almost as an afterthought-- one baking in the kitchen, another locked spread-eagled to the wall of the family&#39;s home, two more distantly pulling a plow in the fields.\n\nIf this was a view of rural Torei, it seemed the ease of obtaining slaves applied even there.\n\n[[Check out a news channel.-&gt;NBRTVNews]]\n[[Check out a sports channel.-&gt;NBRTVSports]]\n[[Check out the channel labeled as &quot;The Way Up Status&quot;.-&gt;NBRTVWU]]\n[[Stop watching TV.-&gt;NBRLounge]]",

A disclaimer, noting access to the International Zone and the Way Up was strictly prohibited to indentured servants and the enslaved.

She&#39;s moaning into the band pulled across her mouth, but rising above even that sound is the constant purr of what could only be multiple vibrators locked within her glistening suit.\n\nA quick examination reveals the majority of her restraints securely anchored, but her gag at least lacks locks-- likely a utilitarian decision, making communication with her captors available at their will.  As it stands, however, Euphoria remains motionless above.

  "DiscussEscape": "&quot;Tell me,&quot; Euphoria commands, and you do.  You speak of the door you found in the storage area, its use unknown, but with clear attempts having been made at opening it.  When she prompts you for evidence you produce the knife, its dulled tip still marred with bits of shaved metal from its failed attempt at disengaging the door.\n\nYour elder Sister concludes with a nod, instructing you to put down the knife nearby before she continues.  &quot;A simple enough story, then.  Very good.  Anything more elaborate would have indicated a distinct lack of care given to the keeping of this establishment&#39;s slaves.  There are but two entrances to these backrooms: the one through which we walked, and the staircase that leads upstairs.  With both locked often enough, Akrai chose the only other route for her attempted escape: the door you found.&quot;\n\nThe bound slave before you continues to writhe in her bonds and punishment, but Euphoria gives little heed.  She was instructing you, and there must always be time enough for that.  &quot;Did you know this Ringdom, Aekora, has a small aquifer?  Not much by offworlder standards, of course, but given the wealth liquid water represents on Torei it is considerable nevertheless.  And it is fed by a series of underground tubes, old lava channels the AIs carved out while they still held dominion over this world in its entirety.  That is where the door you found leads, I would think.  Just as many other buildings around here have similar access.&quot;\n\nShe tips her head slightly to the side, her habit sliding across sloped shoulders.  &quot;Smuggling, storage, or just betting that perhaps one day the AIs will return water flow to most of the system.  Whatever the case may be, if the slave before us reached those tunnels... she could have gotten at least outside Grand Aekora proper before anyone notice.  How very clever.&quot;  Euphoria looks to Akrai, but then turns her red-eyed gaze to you.  &quot;Tell me, Sister: how common do you think runaway slaves are?&quot;\n\n[[&quot;Very common, Sister?&quot;-&gt;NunCommon]]\n[[&quot;Somewhat common, Sister?&quot;-&gt;NunSomewhat]]\n[[&quot;Not common at all, Sister?&quot;-&gt;NunNotCom]]",
  "BeltedTalk": "Sister Euphoria turns, her long cloak flaring as her hands fall upon your shoulders.  &quot;Truly?  Hands behind your back, legs spread.&quot;\n\nYou comply almost without conscious thought, such submission coming to easily to you.  Euphoria responds immediately by stepping closer, surprisingly close, her gleaming laminate pressing against yours as curvaceous forms entwine.  She hooks one leg around your own, spreading you further, while a hand lifts your chin.  The maneuver allows your eyes to meet more readily, her red gaze as always a bit unnerving in its unnatural nature, but it is below where your true concern quickly settles.   Her other hand had fallen to your hips, then slid down to the meeting of your legs.  There she slides beneath the laminate of your panties, the tight cling not enough to prevent her access.\n\nYour freshly installed chastity, however, is another story entirely.  Steel does not budge, nor give way, and in that moment you sense something beyond the serene intensity that marked your elder Sister.  *Pity.*\n\n&quot;You have joined an altogether different Sisterhood now,&quot; she remarks, then presses her own hips forward.  The tight straps running between her legs strain, just audible enough to hear, as she brings her own womanhood up against yours.  Steel to steel, both rendered chaste.  Towering above you, Euphoria&#39;s veiled head eclipses the pale light above, drowning you in shadow as pulls down her muzzle to reveal her marked lips.  Such intimacy marks her question more than anything outwardly sensual could have.\n\n&quot;Know that I pray for you, young Azalea.  Not for you in the now, your first quiet hours in such a state.  But for my Sister three months from now, eternally frustrated.  For the begging you will undertake in half a year, willing to do anything for release, yet *still* incapable of achieving it.  Chastity is a cruelty, Sister.  But a burden you need not bear alone.  As Sisters, as women, as slaves-- we share your pain.&quot;\n\n[[Look down, and nod.-&gt;Belted2]]\n[[&quot;T-Thank you, Sister.&quot;-&gt;Belted2]]",
  "NBRWard4": "The Wardrobe, as always, wastes little time.  As you&#39;re already fitted with cuffs at neck, wrists, and ankles the Wardrobe abandons its usual gripping arms and instead uses simple hooks to lock into the hardpoints mounted on your restraints.  From such mounts it is trivial to spread your legs and raise your arms above your head in preparation.\n\nThe familiar ring-shaped central apparatus then descends, smaller devices grasping at your corset and the laminate panties you wore upon your catsuit.  Both are removed, freeing the way for the belt that is produced from one of the oddly shaped storage sections along the side wall.  Its such a simple thing to mean so much, but that fact that it emerges pre-formed speaks to the rarity of such devices on Torei.  Steel was a rare resource, all but monopolized for use in restraints until certain Ringdoms had started building towers around the space elevator.  Sisters of the Order may be subjected to all the difficulties of poverty, but the network of donators and benefactors ensured *anything* was available if someone took enough of an interest.\n\nSliding the belt up between your waiting legs, it is remarkably cool to the touch as the band begins to tighten around the narrowest portion of your waist.  The catsuit base of your uniform remained however, and it quickly warms the newly added metal and laminate as the Wardrobe&#39;s armatures spring forth.  The U-shaped bottom portion is positioned next, the shield across your womanhood leading down between your legs, where a secondary (and removable) portion covered your rear entrance.  From there it rose again, linking with the band at at your back.  \n\nInch by inch it is cinched closed, growing tighter with every adjustment, until the belt itself firmly embraces you.  Only then do the arms retract, a singular one remaining to press against your shield, delivering a command.  With a sharp *click* the chastity is locked, and a glowing LED ignites just above your sealed womanhood.  The small symbol, a red colored lock, makes your predicament clear for anyone who could observe.\n(if: not ($Inv contains &quot;vow of chastity belt&quot;))[(set: $Inv to $Inv + (a: &quot;vow of chastity belt&quot;))]\n\n(colour: red)[Vow of Chastity Belt added!]\n\n&lt;img alt=&quot;nunbelt&quot; src=&quot;images/gear/nunbelt.png&quot;/&gt;\n\n[[Your cunt already ached with frustrated desire.

An indicator LED is just above the shield itself, glowing red to indicate it remains* **locked**.  *Your frustration builds with every moment sealed inside.*",
  "NBRWard5": "You feel your new belt shift as your hips move, but the Wardrobe continues with its work, unperturbed by your struggle to adapt to the new sensations.  Observation of your belt was not intended for most, and thus your corset and panties are thus returned.  A dozen different armatures make short work of the work, particularly delicate manipulators in particular lacing you in quickly-- trimming off inches before replacing the locks, ensuring your waist would remain at the proportions desired by the Order.\n\nIts all done so quickly, so deftly, you&#39;ve hardly gotten used to the restraints before the Wardrobe removes them and cycles back down into dormancy.  You&#39;re done, your new chastity installed, and as your hands come back down to explore the edition you find it all but impossible to even see the belt itself.  But its there, just as readily as Sister Euphoria&#39;s, denying you access to your own desires.  \n\nJust how effective could it be, though?\n\n[[Try to touch yourself.-&gt;NBRWard6No]]\n[[Exit the Wardrobe.-&gt;NBRWard6Exit]]",
  "NBRWard6No": "Reaching down, your gloved fingers slide beneath the thin laminate of your panties.  The belt awaits, the steel pulled tightly against your womanhood, the laminate backing all but sealed to your catsuit.  Try as you might, and curiosity-- or perhaps simple desire-- pushes you to try for several minutes, you cannot access your most sacred nexus.  The belt allows no friction, not even the sweet tease of shifting laminate against your feminine lips.  There is only the frustration, which builds, the mere thought of being denied something so simple inducing a quiet ecstasy you cannot escape.\n\nAnd indeed, the incapacity was entirely intentional.  Sister Euphoria had mentioned it had been *eight months* since her last period without a belt.  Just what would THAT feel like?  The lighting up of the Wardrobe&#39;s interior screen interrupts any such thoughts, words printing out upon its glass display.\n\n*Slave, lingering in a Wardrobe is strictly prohibited.

Where others had been grasping hands, or multitools, this one is singular in purpose and intent.  The tip of arm is U-shaped, and between those outstretched prongs a sliver of electricity jumps.  \n\nPure instinct backs you towards the door, but you&#39;ve lingered too long, and at full extension it presses into your rear just as you turn.

Your toes ache and your ankles burn, joining the sharp pain that comes from your strictly pinned arms.

As such, we would suggest to the Master of this establishment that Akrai undertake what we in the Order call a March of Atonement.  You have walked the Lead with me, and know of a bit of that experience.  The March is long and arduous, especially restrained in the manner we would supply.  Eight hours at least, moving throughout Grand Aekora.  And of course she would be outfitted with markings that speak publicly of her sins.&quot;\n\nThree fingers rise on the Sister&#39;s gloved hand.  One falls, then a second.  &quot;Another punishment would address instead Akrai&#39;s sense of dignity, that terrible rejection of one&#39;s place that has driven her to sin.  Public display and free use would address such failings, we in fact have a set of permanent stockades near the Convent for such purposes.  And I do mean *free*, all holes available for use.  Although we do of course accept donations towards our Order throughout.&quot;\n\nThe last finger falls, and with it Euphoria lowers her hand.  &quot;The final choice is that... of mercy.  I would not recommend it, and I do not believe it would service Akrai&#39;s path, but I ceded the choice to you, Sister.  It is only proper you select from all available options.  By extending your mercy to Akrai, you would return her to her usual service.  Nothing more would be required of her.&quot;\n\nYour habit shields your eyes as you gaze upon Akrai, her bound form so smooth and glossy, her torturous ecstasy almost making you jealous in that moment.

  "NunDeal": "Passing from the slave quarters, you enter with Euphoria into a small room marked with a barred gate-- and a staircase visible behind it.  The key the bartender had provided allows your Sister access with a simple swipe, and you begin to ascend, the narrow steps requiring careful placement of your heeled boots.  Glancing down briefly, you notice Euphoria is making contact only with her toes, and by emulating it you manage to keep pace.  \n\n&quot;Two pieces are required us, to ensure the Daemon ends its pursuit of you.  The first is upon me, and I will provide what is necessary, as I promised before your conversion.  What you must do, however, is far harder.  Whatever it offers, and a Daemon is capable of offering most anything, you must reject it.  Do you understand me, Sister?  It must be clear to the creature that you no longer seek what it is provided to give.  There can be no deal.&quot;\n\nAt the top of the stairs another door awaits, and while Euphoria places her hand upon it she halts, turning to you.  &quot;I need to hear you say it, Sister.

It is a rare day indeed one draws the attention of Mazos and Dahom, the old gods of this world.  Rarer still is the day such attention proves to be anything but a curse.&quot;\n\nThe door before you opens, and together you spill out to find yourself on a balcony.  This one you recognize as the VIP area glimpsed from the floor before, overlooking the rest of the club itself.  A handful of plush seating areas are occupied, but its towards the hallway along the back wall that you&#39;re lead.  Here the doors are numbered, one through six, and you suddenly realize where you are: the private rooms.  Apparently your deal was to take place in #4.  Coming to a stop before it, the door itself is much the same as any other, the neon number glowing silently.\n\nYou&#39;ve made it.  Despite everything you&#39;ve endured, at the hotel, on the Torean streets, and inside this very Club-- your goal once upon a time is now merely a few steps away.  *The deal.*  You don&#39;t remember the terms, but from what you&#39;ve collected together it simply **must** have been worth all the effort.  Torei was a land of strange wonders, after all, but you&#39;ve changed.  Six vows, the collar around your throat, the uniform you cannot remove.  You&#39;re a slave Sister of the Order of the Primrose now, and this last hurdle must be cleared before you could truly relax into your service, instruction, and bondage.  \n\n&quot;We maintain decorum until circumstances prove otherwise,&quot; Euphoria instructs.  &quot;Knock.&quot;\n\n[[Knock.-&gt;NunDeal3]]",
  "NunDealWhat": "&quot;We have no way of knowing, not with the drug you took to erase your own memory.

He moves to close the door in your face, but Euphoria&#39;s size for once is made apparent, a firm hand upon it halting his efforts as she steps forward.\n\n&quot;*Daemon-Worshipper*, she hisses.  &quot;You will show us your Master, boy.  Certainly you know what we Sisters do to the profligate.&quot;\n\nThe man, already sheet white, nearly collapses from fright.

  "NunDeal6": "Stepping inside the suite reveals it to be sumptuously decorated in dark hues, the most dramatic being laminate material hanging in ridges from a center point in the ceiling to places along the walls-- creating a massive faux-chandelier which reflects the light from sconces carefully placed.  \n\nSo too are you able to look over the man properly, his attire also laminate, a smart suitcoat and tailored trousers rendered in dark grey.  His tie is half undone however, a bit of dishevelment that&#39;s matched by the parlor you&#39;ve entered into.  A sitting room can be seen through a door frame to your left, and before you another door stands closed, but its within this small antechamber itself that it appears the man had been waiting for you.\n\n&quot;I am... you didn&#39;t... how--&quot;  His wheezed concerns are overrun by a now clearly incensed Euphoria.\n\n&quot;Silence.  We are not here for you, as much as it would please me to take you to our convent.  Nor do we seek conflict with your Master.  We are here because of this.&quot;  She pulls forth your black card, a sight that widens the man&#39;s eyes further.\n\n&quot;But I-- I...&quot; he looks to you, squinting through the lenses of his spectacles.  &quot;By the Poles, is that... *you?*  I knew you were submissive, perhaps that is why I was instructed to approach you, but... to submit to...&quot;\n\n&quot;**Silence!**&quot; Euphoria booms, again cutting him off.  &quot;We have come to see this deal concluded, nothing more.  Where is it?&quot;\n\n&quot;T-There...&quot; He points to the closed door.\n\n*It only strikes you then, in that very moment.  Your deal* **was** *with a Daemon, even if this stranger was serving as a middle-man of sorts.  Turning towards the door he had indicated, the closed one that presumably led to a bedroom, its almost like you can sense it.  A slice of divinity, if the AIs were Gods, puppeting a human body like a laminate marionette-- so very close now.  Waiting for you.  With an offer.*\n\n[[You step towards the door.-&gt;NunDeal7]]",
  "NunDeal7": "&quot;Sister.&quot;  Euphoria&#39;s voice, returned to the serenity that stood at such odds with the rage she had directed towards the man, pulls you from the enchanted stare you had taken towards the closed door.  &quot;I cannot go with you.  The Order does not interact with Daemons, not if we can avoid it.  And they in turn leave us alone.  But your case is special, of course, and thus I give you this.&quot;\n\nShe presses into your hand a simple coin, of a metal that&#39;s far heavier than you would expect from its size.  Flipping it over reveals tight script engraved, some vague memory of past suggesting it was of an ancient Torean language.  Certainly you cannot read it.\n\n&quot;To reject the Daemon would not be enough, it would still seek you, or send others in pursuit.&quot;  She spares the man a sharp glance, her red eyes all but burning in that moment.  When they return to you, however, the serenity returns.  A confidence you would do the right thing.  &quot;That coin will be your counter-offer.  It will know what it means.&quot;\n\n[[&quot;Then... tell me Sister.  What are we offering it?&quot;-&gt;NunDeal8Extra]]\n[[&quot;I... understand, Sister.&quot;  Make for the door.-&gt;NunDeal8]]",

  "NunDeal8": "&lt;img alt=&quot;daemon&quot; src=&quot;images/npc/daemon.jpg&quot;/&gt;\n\nThe Daemon, the Emissary, waits for you in the center of the room.  (if: $Daemon is true)[You saw it before, in that alleyway back on the streets, and its much the same as you had glimpsed there.] Its body is uniformly covered in black laminate, stripping it of any individuality or sense of self.  There is no discernible face, only the glossy material remains, stretched so tightly across a male frame as evidenced by narrow hips and wide shoulders. Even so that masculinity is *intense*, as if the Daemon condensed it, adding potency as everything else was stripped away.  In that wake of simplified existence you feel your own curvaceous body all the more readily.  The swell of your breasts, the smooth run from hip to waist, your pert rear-- the other side of the Daemon&#39;s equation.\n\nIt reaches out its hand.\n\n[[Take it.-&gt;NunDeal9]]",
  "NunDeal9": "It has no words for you, and you realize then you wouldn&#39;t need any.  Its grip is firm, having seized your wrist instead of interlocking fingers as equals, drawing you further into the room-- away from the door back into the foyer, and closer to the bed.  Where something is laid out upon it.\n\nA suit.  Black as a night without stars, yet so very reflective, promising to fill that void with sources of light all its own.  Smooth.  Glossy.  Featureless and all-consuming.  And yet... *familiar*.  Standing there before it, it takes you awhile, but you recognize it.  This... was no ordinary suit.  This was *your* isolation suit.  Careful measurement could have confirmed it, but your gut reaction is more then enough, akin to looking into a mirror.  A mirror just like that one you awoke to this morning in that hotel, a mirror you gaze into deeply, seeing not your own reflection but something... else.  A shadow of pleasure and ecstasy.\n\nThe male lifts the helmet, split into two portions yet lacking any hint of a seam.  Within you see the impression of a face-- your face.  And with it comes recollection.\n\n[[You put it all together.-&gt;NunDeal10]]",
  "NunDeal10": "There were never material riches in this deal, and this isn&#39;t your first time on Torei.  As Corinth had suggested, you had come to this planet once, then twice, then again and again-- utterly enthralled by its possibilities.  But you had never indulged, Corinth and the hotel worker had made that clear as well.  An odd mixture of intrigue and restraint, perhaps that was what had drawn them to you.  The polar AIs, through their Daemon, with an offer you came to fear you would not-- could not-- refuse.  \n\nThus the Mem-Burn, the self-bondage.  A last desperate attempt to run out the clock, to force the missing of this rendezvous and drive you once more to the Way Up, this time without reason to return.  All that work, and yet you find yourself already in a collar.  How strange life could be.  But this was a new offer of rapture and euphoria unending, all for the mere cost of your eternal liberty.  \n\nThis was the deal you stood to make now.\n\n[[The helmet is yours, you need only take it...-&gt;NunDeal11]]",
  "NunDeal11": "The choice lies starkly before you, that helmet awaiting your presence.  \n\nTo take it would be to give yourself to the AI.  Inscrutable, unknowable, as harsh and alien as any being in this universe could be.  It would take your body, your liberty, your every waking moment.  But in return?  The potential for bliss unending, delivered by an immortal AI with untold millennia of experience in the arts of sensuality.  Free of conflict and worry, of responsibilities and dilemma.\n\nTo refuse it would be to accept your new life, as a Sister of the Order.  A slave, collared and bound.  In pursuit of the very sort of endless ecstasy the Daemon seemed to offer, albeit in a manner that damned as much as saved.  As a Sister you would almost certainly fail at times, and be punished for it.  The path towards proper perception was long, after all.  To take the Daemon&#39;s offer would be without such choices, such opportunities for failure.  You would be a toy of the AI, lost to the euphoria.  A quicker route along the same path, but one eternally damned.\n\nThe choice is yours.\n\n[[Take the helmet.-&gt;NunTake]]\n[[Refuse the helmet.-&gt;NunRefuse]]",

How could it this easy, to give up everything?  But it is.  Damn it all, it&#39;s as easy as pressing the helmet to your face.  Closer and closer, until finally-- with glorious finality, you feel the impossibly soft laminate of the AI&#39;s construction for the very first time.  It envelopes your lips, your nose, your chin-- then your entire head in its cool embrace.  You&#39;re blinded, gagged, deaf, helpless, even as you feel the Daemon moving the back portion into place to complete the seal.\n\nAfterward he presses against you, masculinity and femininity joining in rapturous union that takes the form of a simple embrace.  Even this first experience feels so strange, so wonderful, so terrifying-- and its only just begun.\n\nYou&#39;re *Lost in Laminate*, and couldn&#39;t be happier.\n(set: $Ending to 1)\n[[Twelve Hours Later.-&gt;VIPTake2]]",
  "NunRefuse": "That insidious curiosity that has defined you had brought you to this planet, again and again.  To look upon its wonders and yet be held apart by an ironclad sense of dignity and restraint.

Now more primal intrigues run rampant, calling for the helmet, for senseless acceptance of eternal servitude.\n\nOnce more.\n\n[[Take the helmet.-&gt;NunTake]]\n[[Refuse the helmet.  &quot;No.&quot;-&gt;NunRefuse3]]",
  "NunRefuse3": "**&quot;No.&quot;**\n\nThe words break the spell, your own reflection catching in the glossy play of light along the mask.  You step back, even as the Daemon remains, still holding the helmet.  When you reach out it is not to take that offer, but to make one of your own.  Euphoria&#39;s token, the dense coin.  It shines in your hand as you hold it aloft, waiting.  The Daemon does not move for some time, the smooth expanse of laminate that made up its head giving no hint of its intentions.  What was it doing?  Considering what you offered?  Preparing to attack?  Communicating with the Poles?\n\nYou will never know.  When it finally acts, it reaches out, taking the offered token.  A quick flick of the wrist and it is gone.  Consumed by the glove, perhaps?  It does not explain, but instead kneels before you.  Still silence prevails, but you see in its lean form subtle movements.  Quaking.  A... reward cycle of some sort?  Or a punishment?\n\nYou get the sense there is little difference to such a creature.\n\n[[Retreat.-&gt;NunRun]]",
  "NunRun": "To persist any longer in its presence would break you, in spite of yourself.  Spinning on your heels, you flee.  Bursting through the door back into the foyer, you startle the man waiting there from his seat, but Euphoria is unflappable.  Her hands had been clasped in prayer, her habit down and covering her eyes, but your arrival breaks her from the pose.\n\n&quot;Sister...?&quot;  When you indicate it is done she embraces you, the busks of your corset running up against hers as she pulls you in tight.  The strength a woman of her size was capable of almost leaves you breathless, but when she finally lets go you can see the sparkle in her eyes.  She may be your Sister, but in that moment she seems more like an approving mother.\n\n&quot;Come, come-- let us leave.

What did it offer you?&quot;  It is a short story, told quickly.  The Daemon had offered nothing less than absolute bliss, in exchange for a servitude more complete than anything you could possibly imagine.\n\n&quot;The... gear a Daemon wears is called an isolation laminate,&quot; your Sister explains, her earlier elation circling down back towards her regular serenity.  And of course, she missed no chance to provide a lesson.  &quot;We know little of what it means to truly wear one.  It is a different sort of reality, we think, to be locked within.  The AIs do not control their puppets with simple commands, or shocks.  They know how the human body works at an intrinsic level, and pull *those* strings with ease.  I doubt the man inside that suit was even fully aware of your presence.&quot;\n\nShe reaches up, fingering the Order&#39;s symbol that served as the pendant for the necklace she wore.  &quot;We are not so much alike, you must have realized that.

  "NunToken": "&quot;It is a promise.  Any Torean will take such a token as payment, knowing the Order will repay in our way.  Be it with the service of our bodies, guidance, or the credits we do occasionally deal in.  But to the AI... it is used for its original use.  The Order was formed in the wake of the Sharecropper Wars, Sister.  When us native Toreans finally broke from the shackles of the AI.  As an alternative to their guidance.  We may seek the same thing, but our path does not require such subservience to their will.  Yet we have, on occasion, needed to trade with Mazos and Dahom, the AI.  Thus the token, a promise as I said.  For tribute, worth the value of that which they gave up.  You.&quot;\n\nEuphoria sighs.  &quot;One of our Order will be given to the AI, eventually.  They will not request haste from us for this.  What is a few years to them, compared to a millennia or two?  But we will pay in time.  Our path, as Sisters, is hard.  Occasionally it has occurred that a Sister has taken their offer, paid for a token, to reach the end of that path much quicker.  They are anathema to our Order, becoming slaves of the AI.  But we recognize their sacrifice.  And there are *always* someone willing to make that sacrifice.

Coming to a stop before it, the door itself is much the same as any other, the neon number glowing silently.\n\nYou&#39;ve made it.  Despite everything you&#39;ve endured, at the hotel, on the Torean streets, and inside this very Club-- your goal once upon a time is now merely a few steps away.  *The deal.*  You don&#39;t remember the terms, but from what you&#39;ve collected together it simply **must** have been worth all the effort.

You&#39;re a slave now, dutifully following your Mistress on a leash, but this one last task must be addressed before your true service could begin.\n\nLooking back at you for a moment, Isabella seems to consider if you should be the one to initiate the meeting-- but in the end she decides as she always did: that you&#39;re merely a slave, and that things are best handled herself.\n\n[[Reaching up, she knocks sharply upon the door.-&gt;IsaDae2]]",

He looks to you(if: $TysusStat is 2)[ and Tysus], promptly notes your collars, and turns back to Isabella.  Her frown had remained in place, but it is joined by a narrowing of eyes.

The look of a huntress on the prowl.\n\n&quot;Servant of the Poles?&quot;  Isabella&#39;s words are a question, the man&#39;s features shifting to shock as your Mistress hones in on her quarry.  &quot;No, nothing so formal.  Some thrall begging for the AI&#39;s scraps, I would guess.&quot;  A hand on the man&#39;s chest pushes him back, the dominatrix emerging fully from Isabella as she strides purposefully into the room.  \n\n[[Your following along is almost an afterthought.-&gt;IsDae4]]",

His tie is half undone however, a bit of dishevelment that&#39;s matched by the parlor you&#39;ve entered into.  A sitting room can be seen through a door frame to your left, and before you another door stands closed, but its within this small antechamber itself that it appears the man had been waiting for you.\n\n&quot;I am... you didn&#39;t... how--&quot;  His wheezed concerns are overrun by Isabella&#39;s imperious poise and cadence.\n\n&quot;You will shut your kamned mouth, and you will listen, whatever you are.

To your surprise he complies, all but collapsing into the couch as his distress bubbles over.  Very clearly this was not what he had intended.  Isabella doesn&#39;t allow him a moment&#39;s rest, but asks the obvious question.  &quot;It is here, then?  The... Emissary?&quot;\n\n&quot;T-There...&quot; He points to the closed door.\n\n*It only strikes you then, in that very moment.

I am going to keep you as you are, gagged and bound.

There is no discernible face, only the glossy material remains, stretched so tightly across a male frame as evidenced by narrow hips and wide shoulders. Even so that masculinity is *intense*, as if the Daemon condensed it, adding potency as everything else was stripped away.  In that wake of simplified existence you feel your own curvaceous body all the more readily.  The swell of your breasts, the smooth run from hip to waist, your pert rear-- the other side of the Daemon&#39;s equation.\n\nIt reaches out its hand.\n\n[[Step forward.-&gt;IsDae7]]",
  "IsDae7": "It has no words for you, and you realize then you wouldn&#39;t need any.  Its grip is firm, having seized you by the ring on your collar, drawing you further into the room-- away from the door back into the foyer, and closer to the bed.  Where something is laid out upon it.\n\nA suit.  Black as a night without stars, yet so very reflective, promising to fill that void with sources of light all its own.  Smooth.  Glossy.  Featureless and all-consuming.  And yet... *familiar*.  Standing there before it, it takes you awhile, but you recognize it.  This... was no ordinary suit.  This was *your* isolation suit.  Careful measurement could have confirmed it, but your gut reaction is more then enough, akin to looking into a mirror.  A mirror just like that one you awoke to this morning in that hotel, a mirror you gaze into deeply, seeing not your own reflection but something... else.  A shadow of pleasure and ecstasy.\n\nThe male lifts the helmet, split into two portions yet lacking any hint of a seam.  Within you see the impression of a face-- your face.

As Corinth had suggested, you had come to this planet once, then twice, then again and again-- utterly enthralled by its possibilities.  But you had never indulged, Corinth and the hotel worker had made that clear as well.  An odd mixture of intrigue and restraint, perhaps that was what had drawn them to you.  The polar AIs, through their Daemon, with an offer you came to fear you would not-- could not-- refuse.  \n\nThus the Mem-Burn, the self-bondage.  A last desperate attempt to run out the clock, to force the missing of this rendezvous and drive you once more to the Way Up, this time without reason to return.  All that work, and yet you find yourself already in a collar.  How strange life could be.  But this was a new offer of rapture and euphoria unending, all for the mere cost of your eternal liberty.  \n\nThis was the deal you stood to make now.\n\n[[The helmet is yours, you need only take it...-&gt;IsDae9]]",

The potential for bliss unending, delivered by an immortal AI with untold millennia of experience in the arts of sensuality.  Free of conflict and worry, of responsibilities and dilemma.\n\nTo refuse it would be to accept your new life, as plaything and sexual toy to Isabella.  A slave, collared and bound.  One of the endless multitudes who had descended the Way Up, and found in Torei an offer of a very different sort you had proven incapable of refusing.

Damn it all, it&#39;s as easy as allowing the helmet to be pressed against your face.  Closer and closer, until finally-- with glorious finality, you feel the impossibly soft laminate of the AI&#39;s construction for the very first time.  It envelopes your lips, your nose, your chin-- then your entire head in its cool embrace.  You&#39;re blinded, gagged, deaf, helpless, even as you feel the Daemon moving the back portion into place to complete the seal.\n\nAfterward he presses against you, masculinity and femininity joining in rapturous union that takes the form of a simple embrace.

Communicating with the Poles?\n\nYou will never know. It does not explain, but instead kneels before you.  Still silence prevails, but you see in its lean form subtle movements.  Quaking.

For you, one your feet and rolling with the proverbial punches Torei had thrown at you since waking, the wait is even more dangerous.  You find yourself struggling to stay away, nearly nodding off twice before the bedroom door opens suddenly.\n\nThe male Daemon strides out, utterly ignoring you as it crosses the antechamber, and enters the suite&#39;s other room.

It has no visible eyes or mouth, no way to breath or speak.  It could have been a doll of some sort had you not noticed the way its chest rises and falls, moments before it shifts, writhing upon laminate sheets.  Isabella&#39;s provided gear is discarded on the floor, and while the figure is not bound you sense immediately a distinct lack of liberty.  A... submission to something you can barely understand.  How long had it been since she was led to the Daemon?  An hour, maybe two?  The conversion had been so quick, and now...\n\n*What once had been a proud member of Torean nobility is a seamless isolation laminated Daemon.*  \n\nIt pumps its hips forward, as if being taken in both holes at once as you watch.

  "PonyCount2": "Time passes.  You’ve settled into something you’re your normal routine, high-stepping sharply forward.  It’s a state that allows your mind to wander, as you think back on your return to Torei, all those months ago.  If only your former self could see you now.  What would you think of the woman in full tack and harness, laminate gleaming yet so utterly exposed at breast and cunt?  Would you cringe at the constant threat of the unseen whip, or pity the tight bondage that kept your arms pinned uselessly behind your back, the bit seated firmly between your teeth?  Or… perhaps she would envy your submission, your clarity of purpose.  Your collar has taken so much from you, remade you as a beast of burden—a pack animal—but it has taken much of your worldly concerns as well.\n\nNo longer do you think much about the future or question your own actions.  There is only the next step ahead of you, fresh air on the open plains of rural Aekora, and the prospect of the deep sleep that came with utter and total exhaustion.  At the very least you’re the most in-shape you’ve ever been in your life.  Daily toil in the harness had strengthened your leg muscles of course, but your abdomen is relatively well defined as well—the brunt of the weight of the cart behind falling on your shoulders and working your core as you high-step forward.  A hard life, true… but fulfilling too.\n\nEvery step is announced by the sharp sound of your steel-shod hoof impacting the pavement, joining the symphony of similar sounds formed by your fellow ponies.  It’s an almost musical sound accompanied by the rattle of your harness, the chains linking you to the cart clinking softly.  Further behind the cart rumbles inexorably.\n\nA familiar cacophony, joined suddenly by the snap of the whip upon your Lead’s right flank, nearest you.\n\n[[Turn Left!-&gt;PEvent1Good]]\n[[Turn Right!-&gt;PEvent1Bad]]",
  "PonyCount3": "Marching ever forward, hours pass.  The scenery ahead suddenly proves at least a *bit* interesting as a farm comes into view, however.  One of the nameless hundreds of homesteads out here on the frontier, this particular building is relatively unremarkable, but there are at least other women visible in the fields.\n\nAs a menial-labor slave your position in Torean society is rather low, but as always there is a deeper hierarchy, and amongst ponies you’re perhaps somewhere in the middle.  Show ponies were far more prestigious, while beneath you were the farm chattel you observe now.  One such creature, laboring in a full laminate uniform and mask, pulls a heavy plow as you pass by.  Out from the shadow of the Way Up, technology often got rather archaic, you’ve come to learn.\n\nFor a moment fate intervenes, allowing you to meet the other pony’s eyes despite the blinders you both wore, and in that gaze is… understanding, perhaps.  She knew how far your station remained, just as you knew that pony would be working in the field for the rest of the day.  Amongst the millions of enslaved women on Torei, you share a similar fate.\n\nYet the farmer overseeing the slave’s work pointedly looks away.  She would not want to draw the attention of your Master, or his subordinate Officers.\n\nThat your entire team had slowed just a bit is made clear by the sudden strike of the whip, Officer Karsis chuckling as he expertly maneuvers the whip between your legs, the heavy laminate curling there to slap sharply against your cunt.  \n\n“Come on, girls.  No gawking!”\n\n[[You join with your fellow ponies in a shared moan.  “Mmmgh!”-&gt;PonyCount4]]",
  "PonyCount4": "You can feel the burn by now.  How long has it been?  Three, maybe four hours?  Maybe you’re approaching the promised break.  You certainly hope so.  Even your boots could only do so much, a pace this strict maintained for so long wearing you down.  Your thighs ache, your back aches, you want to stop.  But you know you cannot.  At best you can bite down all that harder on your bit, moaning quietly to yourself as you take yet another high-step.  Then another, and another.  Dozens, hundreds, even thousands.  A bit of drool runs down to land upon your chest, sizzling on your sun-baked skin.  You’re sweating freely, rivulets running down your firm thighs.  \n\nYour breathing is heavy too, lips pulled back to add what you can through your mouth to that inhaled through your septum-pierced nose.  Similar half-snorts and sharp gasps come from your fellow slaves, their work just as grinding in its exhaustion.  And you’re not even halfway there yet.\n\nYour submissive-addled thoughts are shattered suddenly, however, by a fresh application of the whip.  It lands upon your Lead’s left flank, another command to turn.\n\n[[Turn left!-&gt;PEvent2Bad]]\n[[Turn right!-&gt;PEvent2Good]]",
  "PonyCount5": " Finally you see it: the promised tree, a massive growth emerging from the lichen fields beside the road.  A stranger in a strange land, but a welcome one as Master Karsis flicks his whip once, slowing you to a walk.  Coming up alongside the tree, the pull on your reins finally comes, the laminate straps running from your head harness used only for halting.  You stop with the rest of your team, panting almost in unison.  Each sharp breath shifts your septum piercing, while your full breasts rise and fall, sweat running freely down laminate and skin alike.\n\n“Rest stance,” Karsis commands, and while you move immediately to a kneeling position—thankful for the mercy—you also realize in that moment you have not been stopped beneath the shade of the tree.  In fact you’re just outside of it.  \n\n[[Apparently that privilege is to be reserved for the Officers alone.-&gt;PonyEvent3Rest]]",
  "PonyCount6": "Once more your legs rise, the equine high step demanded of you repeated, again and again.  The scenery before you rarely changes, lichen fields only occasionally devolving into the first hints of the wasteland you knew that stretched towards the poles.  What little of interest *does* manage to enter your view just as often leave suddenly, your blinders keeping your attention forward, denying you the opportunity to be distracted.\n\nAnd thus it continues, step after step, hour after hour.  By the time a fresh set of buildings appear on the horizon you&#39;re too exhausted to even care.  Your pupils are dilated, your breathing coming in heavy pants, even your saliva is mostly gone-- a bit of lathered froth clinging to your bit the only hint it had once been present.  Two hours, perhaps three ago the burn in your legs had finally disappeared.  As had much of your higher thought processes.  You&#39;re deep into the submissive mindset now, your legs churning without conscious thought, sweat dripping down as you pump them up, still high stepping.  Both of your breasts bounce merrily, and you bite down even harder on your bit, your emptied mind having all but forgotten how it felt to be without.\n\nEven the lick of Master Karsis&#39; whip is a distant afterthought now, but you recognize what a sudden pull on your reins meant.\n\n[[To stop.-&gt;Pony7]]",
  "Pony7": "Pulling up short, chest rising with each sharp intake of breath, you blink-- and realize a small settlement surrounds you.  *Home*, as best you could call it these days.  The border post is little more than the local precinct and a handful of merchants and their households clustered around it, but you only focus on what it meant: your march is finally over.  \n\nYet even now, relief does not come immediately.  On Torei presentation mattered just as much as actual action, and ponies simply were not rested in the street.  So you stand, back straight, maintaining your pose as the Officers you had transported disembark.  The two women haul out their cage, the truant woman within squealing from behind her gag.  Master Karsis accompanies them, as their superior.  Certainly he has no fear of your fleeing while left alone.  You&#39;re still chained to the carriage, without any means of releasing yourself.\n\n[[So you stand at attention, and wait...-&gt;Pony8]]",
  "Pony8": "A gentle tap on your hip announces your Lead, 5-3.  She&#39;s still gagged as you are, and just as exhausted, but she makes the effort nevertheless to address each member of her team.  Her acknowledgement is simple, a quiet snort between equally gasped breaths, but the message is clear: *well-done.*\n\nAs you wait, others pass by.  Some collared, most not-- liberty among the lichen-farms still ran strong.  All of them pointedly ignore you and your fellow ponies, although not out of any fear of yourself.  You&#39;re little more than an animal after all, bound and restrained, defenseless.  But the markings upon your tack and harness make you something to avoid, as every Torean (or offworlder with the guts to come out his far) knew.  The Ministry of Truants was best left alone.\n\nThus the quiet solitude as pain reemerges in your legs, the empty-headed numbness of the march slowly withdrawing.  You stand, back straight, pressing your chest out prominently.  That was expected.  Master Karsis would return in time, or send one of the precinct&#39;s lesser Officers.  Your team would finally be unhitched and scrubbed clean, then put down to rest in the stables.  Your cell awaited there, one of a dozen or so caged stalls with a concrete floor.  Sometimes they removed your armbinder and bit, often they just left it in.  Either way, you would bed down on the thin padding that served as your bedding.  There you would fall quickly into sleep, after such a march...\n\n...only to rise again tomorrow, to pull another carriage.  If that was not needed, you would be worked in the yard.  Pushed to your physical limits and hardened, guided with a firm hand on your reins and a strict whip in hand.  Day upon day, week up week... for years...\n\n[[A pony&#39;s life was never easy.-&gt;Ending]]",
  "NunFinale": "With Euphoria as your guide, the work at Club Lush does end.  By passing through the backrooms once more you spill out onto the ground floor, only to find Truant Officers moving through the crowds, checking papers and IDs.  A simple sweep for Truants, your Sister explains, and something you need not fear.  As such she presents you to the first one that approaches, a check of your ID taking only moments.  You are a slave, as your collar indicated, on proper business with your elder Sister.  You&#39;re only made to kneel amongst the teeming crowds for a few minutes before Euphoria sweeps to her feet, leading you in dual reverences towards the Officer before you press on.  A brief stop at the bar to speak to the bartender seals Akrai&#39;s fate, and then you make for the exit.\n\nAfter all day in heels, especially with the stricture your new uniform commanded, your feet are aching-- but you still have a long walk to go.  Euphoria sets a strict pace, leading the way back to the transport station, and the Lead.  As before you&#39;re gagged and blindfolded, requiring a march back towards the city outskirts that pushes you to the brink of exhaustion.  It truly is a mercy as you feel your lead come to a halt, and an attendant helps uncouple you.  From there, finally, you are mere moments from your new home.\n\n[[The Convent of Perception awaits.-&gt;NunFin2]]",
  "NunFin2": "Morning approaches.  Over the tops of the fence you can see the barest hint of a reddish-hue on the horizon, Torei&#39;s lonely star breaking once more across the world.  But you turn from it, your gaze instead falling upon the yawning black maw that is the Convent&#39;s doorway.  Deep in the garden where you had first met Euphoria, the red-uniformed Sister now holds the door for you, a gloved hand gesturing.\n\n&quot;Come, Sister.  I know the night has been long, but I will show you to your quarters, and we both can get some rest.  I will guide you through the darkness, but I am certain you will grow accustomed to it.  Welcome.&quot;\n\nShe reaches out towards you.\n\n[[Take her hand.-&gt;NunFinTake]]\n[[&quot;Is it truly all darkness within, Sister?&quot;-&gt;NunFinDark]]",
  "NunFinTake": "Together you enter, each glossy inch of your laminate being swallowed by the darkness as you step into it readily.  Still holding your hand, Euphoria positions herself behind you, her other hand upon your shoulder.  The sharp snap of both your heeled boots echo in the emptiness that confronts you, but Euphoria guides readily, through what you can only imagine are several rooms.  In one you hear the telltale moans, the groaning laminate straps of active prayer as the Order knew it, but much is simple silence.  The muzzle across your mouth restricted speech somewhat after all, and quiet contemplation should be expected in a place such as this.\n\nBut light does eventually blossom before your eyes, even if it is dim.  A hallway carved from the stone of the Convent, guttering torch-like lights along the walls projecting a dim red glow.  The stark lines of the door-less passage look almost ominous in such light, a sentiment furthered by a glance up, where a sentence is engraved in the stone itself.\n\n(colour: red)[*Visitors Turn Back, Herein Find Only Sinners Worthy of Punishment*]\n\n&quot;We enter now into the Convent&#39;s sanctum,&quot; Euphoria explains at your side, her voice quiet yet carrying far given the prevailing silence.  &quot;Beyond this point, we do not permit those worthy of liberty-- or those who claim it.  Freewombs, free men.  Our guests and benefactors.  This is a place of great Sin, for those who have admitted-- as we both have-- that we are weak and incapable.  That we *need* the stricture our Order provides.  A place that we live, work, sleep, and can be punished as we so clearly deserve.&quot;\n\nShe pushes you forward a bit, passing into the red-lit passage.  &quot;This is your home now, and like every Sister, you have been assigned a cell within.  Come.&quot;\n\n[[Another Sinner comes home...-&gt;NunFin3]]",
  "NunFinDark": "Euphoria&#39;s veiled head shifts back and forth.  &quot;You will recall, Sister, that by restricting our senses we open our perception to our sensations.  But we *do* recognize Novitiates such as yourself require a bit more than faith and submission can provide.  There is a portion of the Convent within where a certain sort of light is allowed.  Come, I will guide you to it.&quot;\n\n[[Take her hand.-&gt;NunFinTake]]",
  "NunFin3": "The silence breaks as you proceed through tight passages.  You pass several small rooms, within which Sisters move about.  Some work at desks, many merely in prayer.  Their recited strictures echo out into the stony hallways, joining the click of your heels upon the floor.  Others are clearly involved in more sensual practices, their moans and struggling just as notable, although Euphoria&#39;s guidance grows more stern when you try to linger.  \n\n&quot;The commissary,&quot; she explains, pausing momentarily at the doorway to a larger room.  &quot;We are allowed food twice a day, after morning and evening prayers.  As devoted slaves we are of course only allowed slave feed.  A Torean tradition, if you are not familiar.  It is not appetizing, there is little flavor or texture.  But it does provide suitable energy, and that is all we require to serve.  I rarely find myself dreaming of real food anymore.&quot;\n\nEuphoria sounds less wistful then you may have imagined, as if forgetting regular food existed was desirable.  Either way she presses on, turning off into a side corridor.  Here the narrow walls are lined with what you can only equate to prison doors, heavy steel doors covered in intricate filigree.  Each bear three placards, the words upon them varying slightly on each.\n\nIris, Sinner, Slave.  Marigold, Sinner, Slave-- and so on, until Euphoria comes to a stop before the last door at the end.\n\n**AZALEA\nSINNER \nSLAVE**\n\n&quot;Your cell,&quot; Euphoria announces, unlocking it a physical key she produces from her vestments.\n\n[[With a heavy click, she swings it open.-&gt;NunFin4]]",
  "NunFin4": "&lt;img alt=&quot;nuncell&quot; src=&quot;images/reg/nuncell.png&quot;/&gt;\n\nYour cell is small.  Intensely so.  Formed entirely from concrete, it is not tall enough to stand in, nor long enough to lay down.  There are no furnishings, no bed or storage, the only break in the otherwise smooth walls being a small alcove cut into the back.  A book is seated there, the elaborate designs marking it undeniably as the scripture Euphoria has thus far been referencing from memory.  \n\n&quot;We are not allowed much in the way of comforts,&quot; Euphoria explains at your side.  &quot;As slaves, such things are wasted on us as a matter of point, but we have found that such... simple living encourages reflection.  Contemplation.  You will have plenty of time for such, and prayer besides, during your time in your cell.  Although I suspect you will learn quickly to catch what sleep you can.  It is difficult, given the size of our cells, I have found kneeling-- a Sister&#39;s proper place-- to be the most endurable of poses when with.  Undoubtedly this is by design.&quot;\n\nA sweeping hand indicates the cell.  &quot;Enter, Sister.&quot;\n\n[[Enter your cell.-&gt;Nunfin5Good]]\n[[&quot;This is... truly all that we are allowed?&quot;-&gt;NunFin5Bad]]",
  "Nunfin5Good": "Bending over to enter your small cell, you quickly resolve to take Euphoria&#39;s advice, adopting a kneeling position as you turn around to face the Sister still standing outside.  As soon as she sees you comfortable, however, she moves to close the door.  It does so with a foreboding *thunk*, the heavy lock being turned off moments latter.  In that finality of silence that follows you recognize just how confined the cell is, your heels nearly scraping the back wall even as your knees approach the door.  And you&#39;re to be kept in such a place, for hours at a time?\n\nA small panel above you slides open, bars preventing anything from being slid through.  Euphoria peers in, her eyes searching in an almost motherly fashion.

  "NunFin5Bad": "&quot;It is, Sister.&quot;  Euphoria&#39;s response comes with a knowing look.  &quot;It is bare, and uncomfortable.  I understand this.  Even as a fully confirmed member of the Order, I am confined to such a cell as well.  Remember your vows.  We are allowed no wealth, we serve as commanded.  Thus... this is how it must be.  But I promise you, Sister, it *will* make you stronger.  You may wear our regalia, but you thought and action remains crude.

  "NunFin6Lie": "&quot;A sin,&quot; Euphoria notes sharply.  &quot;To lie to your Sisters.  I know very well such a cell is *not* comfortable.  But you must endure, nevertheless.

Every component of your uniform works together, adjusting your posture, denying you comfort, emphasizing your most pleasing aspects: pierced nipples visible through the laminate cups of your suit, the smooth curve of your rear, the tight cinching of your waist.  Even your permanent cuffs and collar eventually announce themselves, the subtle *click* of the mounting-rings that emerge from them all but deafening in the encroaching silence. \n\nAs readily as your vows, your uniform defines you as a slave now.](if: $Wait is 3)[As you grow accustomed to the sounds you make, you prove capable of screening them out.

Perhaps a prayer?  \n\nDeep in the heart of the Convent, you come to terms with the silence that prevailed.  You&#39;re an outside now, but soon it will take you in, become not only normalized but *comforting*.  Even now, you find a simple sort of peace in that silence, despite your predicament.

All of it had been swirling madness as you traipsed through it, but looking back with the benefit of hindsight you discern something... else.  A path.  All of it, from wardrobe to the streets, from Club Lush to the Convent, had led you here.  To this moment.  Each choice had been a step, just as Sister Euphoria had tried to explain earlier in the day.  One after the other, sometimes winding, sometimes direct.

A shared recognition that you were not strong enough to go on alone, or that perhaps you needed the guidance only Sisterhood could provide.

Thus I give you solace: a gag you will wear throughout.&quot;\n(if: not ($Inv contains &quot;ring gag&quot;))[(set: $Inv to $Inv + (a: &quot;ring gag&quot;))]\n(colour: red)[Ring Gag added.]\n\nThe black ring she seats behind your foremost teeth is slightly padded, but the size of it forces your mouth almost painfully apart, the empty circle formed so readily apparent.  Ecstasy wastes little time in filling it, although you&#39;re only treated to a brief glimpse of what she pushes into your mouth.\n(if: not ($Inv contains &quot;oral cock insert&quot;))[(set: $Inv to $Inv + (a: &quot;oral cock insert&quot;))]\n(colour: red)[Oral Cock Insert added.]\n\nA laminate phallus, your tongue informs, exploring the freshly installed device.  It snaps magnetically to the ring already occupying you, the lengthy member threatening to tickle the back of your throat.  You try to push it out, if only as an automatic response, but find it unmoving-- the web of straps she arranges around your head, beneath your habit, keep it firmly in place.  \n\nPulling your muzzle back up, the thin layer of laminate that covered from chin to nose, your predicament is only hinted at by the straps that emerge and cross your head.  At your side, Euphoria tips her head.  &quot;Comfortable, Sister?&quot;\n\n[[No!  &quot;Mmmmgh!&quot;-&gt;NunWalk4]]\n[[Yes... &quot;Mmmghhh...&quot;-&gt;NunWalk4]]",

  "IsaFinale": "&lt;img alt=&quot;nik&quot; src=&quot;images/npc/nik.jpg&quot;/&gt;\n\nPassing through the thronging crowds on Club Lush&#39;s ground floor, you notice one of the Officers near the front door.  You recognize her as Nikaido, the one who had pulled you aside on the Torean streets, seeking that runaway.  You had stood out then, still getting your proverbial footing amongst the wild unknown that had been Torei, but you don&#39;t know.  In fact you&#39;re not even noticed as your Mistress leads you by, just one more slave properly leashed and being led by her owner.  Cherish is just a bit further on, apparently waiting for another VIP to greet upon entering.  She curtsies for Isabella before opening the door, while you&#39;re only given a quick look-- and a wave goodbye as you step from the Club altogether.\n\n&quot;I already sent ahead,&quot; Isabella notes, returning her glass device to her pocket.  &quot;Knowing Talance, she probably already had my girls harnessed, just waiting for the call.  I am certain she will be along shortly.&quot;\n\nThe walkways surrounding Club Lush and most of downtown remained covered, skirting around the curfew laws.  Isabella takes you to a point that opened up to the empty street, broken only occasionally by another carriage arriving to pickup or dispense other club goers.  You&#39;re instructed to kneel at her side, waiting patiently like any of the other attendant slaves.  You of course have your three plugs, two between your legs, one lodged inside your mouth, to occupy the time anyway.  Some of your fellows are not so fortunate-- the blonde further up has barely any bondage at all!\n\n[[Lucky girl.-&gt;IsaFinale2]]\n[[Poor girl!-&gt;IsaFinale2]]",
  "IsaFinale2": "&lt;img alt=&quot;talance&quot; src=&quot;images/npc/talance.png&quot;/&gt;\n\nYour wait, as promised, isn&#39;t very long.  Isabella had barely the time to pull forth her cigarette before the clatter of wheels upon the road outside announced the arrival of another carriage, glossy and white, the two ponygirls harnessed to the front in red livery.  Your eyes are drawn to that pair, their bodies more exposed than covered in laminate for once, but the sharp tug on your collar is insistent-- your Mistress always demanded much of your attention.\n\n&quot;Mistress,&quot; the driver atop greets coolly, her wing-tipped eyes calmly looking you over.  &quot;This is...?&quot;\n\n&quot;$Name,&quot; Isabella replies, pulling you up beside her, a hand at the small of your back there reassuringly.  &quot;My new slave.&quot;\n\n&quot;An offworlder?&quot;\n\nIsabella nods.  &quot;Yes.&quot;\n\nThe driver does not exactly smile, but there is something like a smirk there.  Turning a bit further to look at you reveals pale, almost porcelain skin beneath her long laminate cloak, wearing little more than lingerie despite the slight chill in the night air.  Her dark eyes sparkle.  &quot;I haven&#39;t gotten to break an offworlder before.&quot;\n\n&quot;You will, Talance.&quot;  Your Mistress then looks to you, gesturing to the driver above.  &quot;Every proper Torean household has a hierarchy, $Name.  And you will be at the very bottom of course, as I decide how I want to use you.  This is Talance, another of my slaves.  She is my governess, and thus your superior.

The interior is plush, the white coloration of the cab continued within.  Guiding into a seat, you almost seem to sink into the comfortable material.  In fact it feels so good to be off your feet for a moment that Isabella is on the second restraint before your eyes open again to find her hooking your various points of bondage to several hardpoints built into the seat.

  "Isa5": "You awaken with a hand upon your face, gloved fingers guiding your chin first to the left, then to the right.

There is much I can work with here, for the Mistress.  Hard exercise, corsetry work, your new diet... yes.  I&#39;ll have you filled out, with a nice thigh gap, before these six weeks are up.&quot;\n\nShe leans back, and for the first time you realize she&#39;s effectively seated upon your lap, straddling you with her knees upon the seat you remain locked to.  You&#39;re defenseless, and Talance seems to revel in that fact, her fingers tracing along the smooth laminate of your shoulders and bust.  &quot;We&#39;re here,&quot; she explains.  &quot;Mistress already went up, to take a shower and change for your little... welcome home party, I suppose.  So I&#39;m going to be showing you the basics, and we can decide upon what you&#39;re going to use your $IsFavor merits on.

When your Governess presses a button on the elevator&#39;s control panel she selects a penthouse, one near the top of the tower.  Grand Aekora did not feature the massive skyscrapers that encircled the Way Up, but your ascension still takes time, up and up until a quiet little *ting* announces your arrival.  The antechamber that greets you features three doors.  Talance leads you towards the center one, a small plaque of silvered steel announcing the resident: I. Naram-Sin.  Your Mistress&#39; suite.\n\nWith a small keycard the door is opened, and you get the first glimpse of your new home.  It is both larger than you expected and yet somehow smaller, the center room two stories high, with massive windows looking out over Grand Aekora proper.  Wealth is demonstrated in every detail, from the floors that almost look like real wood-- which would have been exceedingly expensive on resource poor Torei-- to the plush furniture and thick carpets.  Light music plays from a source you cannot locate, but as you look around you notice only a few doorways leading elsewhere.  So most of the suite itself had to be this room, massive as it is.\n\n&quot;The living area,&quot; Talance explains from her position just before you, turning to indicate the attached kitchen.  &quot;And dining area.  Mistress enjoys entertaining when not roaming the city, so expect to spend most of your time here.  You are *not* allowed access to the food storage, but Rei will provide you with meals as required.  She is the Mistress&#39; soubrette, and is quite the skilled cook-- although you are unlikely to enjoy it often.&quot;\n\n[[Remain silent.-&gt;Isa10]]\n[[&quot;What do you mean, Governess?&quot;-&gt;Isa10]]",

Promotes silky hair, a full bust, that sort of thing.&quot;\n\nHer explanation makes it sound like pet food, and you&#39;re hungry enough in that moment to eat just about anything.  But to only be served such, day after day, for six weeks?  The Governess seems to read your thoughts, even as she reaches out, flicking a bit of dust from the laminate covering your shoulders.  &quot;You do have your merits, though.  We will discuss them at the end of the tour, but take note: you could use one here.  Mistress would allow you some of her food then, or perhaps instruct Rei to prepare you meals from her stock of supplies.&quot;\n\nThe Governess shrugs her lithe shoulders.  &quot;I find the Mistress&#39; meals to be too rich for anything more than a treat though, after so many years of slave feed.  Anyway-- let us see if you are at least the tiny bit observant.&quot;\n\nStanding at your side, her arm extends, indicating a doorway marked with a Torean symbol of some sort.  Then she reverses direction, bringing your attention to the only other doorway besides the entrance, this one situated on the far side of the room and bearing another but different symbol above it.  \n\n&quot;Can you derive what these mean, slave?&quot;\n\n[[&quot;Different... wings of the suite, Governess?&quot;-&gt;Isa11A]]\n[[&quot;Slave and... owner quarters, Governess?&quot;-&gt;Isa11B]]\n[[&quot;I&#39;m too wet to think straight, Governess..&quot;-&gt;Isa11C]]",

Mistress&#39; ponies are kept in the stables, located in the basement of this building.  Rei, you, and I do have small areas allowed to us up here.  Mostly you will use the area for sleeping.

It is between the slave&#39;s legs, however, where you find yourself staring-- she&#39;s seated on a chair leaned all the way back, a pair of padded leg rests keeping her limbs spread, revealing the bright purple pussy so readily apparent there.  You&#39;ve never seen anything like it, this planet&#39;s strange perversions leaving you unsure if it were merely a laminate facsimile, or the real deal altered by some intensive sort of biomedical procedure.  Either way she is on full display to the crowd, the restraints at her ankles keeping her there.  A second set of cuffs at her wrists allow her some movement, a few inches back and forth, but not nearly enough to escape.\n\nHer struggle to contest the saleswoman&#39;s claim of enjoying this treatment is ended by the latter&#39;s twisting of a nozzle on the bottle attached to the slave&#39;s mask, causing the woman to trashing momentarily, her moans growing frantic-- before they slide away, replaced by the sound of heavy breathing.  Her struggle slows, only to be replaced by her gloved hands moving along her own body, the chains just long enough to allow it.  Briefly fondling her breasts, she eventually pushes her fingers into that vibrantly colored cunt, rubbing as she moans like a beast in heat.\n\n&quot;See?&quot;  The saleswoman at her side pets the slave&#39;s head softly, eliciting another, far more gentle, moan.  &quot;Here on Torei, we have long cultivated a variety of plants with aphrodisiac qualities!

As it is you finally inhale sharply.  You&#39;re not exactly sure what you were expecting, but what you *get* is a vaguely sweet scent, the air somehow heavier going down, the sensation of it running down your lungs quite evident.  As you lean back from the mask it bottoms out within you, a growing warmth starting in your chest, then spreading out from there.  It feels... *really good*.\n\nYou stifle a quiet moan, leaning against the chair upon which the slave was fastened, trying to collect yourself.  Its hard.

Even as you stare, however, the saleswoman lifts the canister and mask to your face again.  You turn to meet it with a surprising amount of eagerness, this time breathing deeply immediately.  Your fervor is rewarded with a return of the warmth that had been leaking from you, burning brightly in your lungs until it spreads out as before.  This second dose hits harder than the first, however, the heat between your legs coming immediately, drawing your hand down without any regard for the crowd watching this time.\n\n(if: $Blue is true)[You rub wantonly at the meeting of your thighs, the slick blue material of your catsuit only adding to the sensation. ] (if: $Smoke is true)[You rub wantonly at the meeting of your thighs, the slick smoky material of your catsuit only adding to the sensation.] (if: $Brand is true)[You rub wantonly at the meeting of your advertisement-marked thighs, the slick black material of your catsuit only adding to the sensation.] (if: $Sec is true)[Hiking your skirt up a bit, you press your fingers directly into your cunt, rubbing with wanton abandon.]   Leaning back against the bound slave&#39;s chair, you tilt your head back, riding the wave of pleasure as it overtakes you.  The experience is blissfully complete, your worries and concerns lost in the sea of pleasure invoked by that sweet scent.  \n\nComing down from the high is harder, more frustrating.  You had not managed to satisfy yourself before your eyes flicker open, and you find that your sense of dignity had indeed returned.  You blush, even as the enthusiastic crowd claps to the saleswoman&#39;s continued pitch, her words lost on you as you look down, (if: $Sec is true)[ashamed to find a line of your own desire running down your leg.](else: )[so very aware of the wetness of your womanhood, beneath the thin laminate of your suit.]\n\n&quot;How about the *full* experience?&quot;  The saleswoman had returned her attention to you, her smile no longer appealing, or shady-- it is downright predatory now.  &quot;I&#39;ll pay you 200 credits to take a full bottle, just like my *other* lovely volunteer.&quot;\n\nShe gestures to the slave still bound beside you, the tubes connecting her mask to the very large bottle of aphrodisiac quite evident now.  She... had been a volunteer?  Like you?  But she had seemed so resistant when you had first approached, at least until her bottle&#39;s nozzle was opened up a bit further.  How... how would that feel?  Wonderful.  You know the answer to that question, a rare experience you must admit, since waking up.  It would feel *wonderful...*\n\n&quot;Come on, take another breath,&quot; the saleswoman holds up the mask again, the bottle you&#39;ve been breathing from so small now.  &quot;It will help you decide.&quot;\n\n[[&quot;Please... please, more...&quot;  Take a breath.-&gt;ApproDose3]]\n[[&quot;N-No...

  "StopAppro": "You bring together what willpower you still have, drawing upon it all to shake your head back and forth, the movement at least serving to bring you fresh air untainted by the toxin the saleswoman was peddling.  Her smile remains, but you sense a disappointment there, especially as you spoke your refusal so clearly.  That had probably been a good idea, with the crowd around she couldn&#39;t exactly contest it.  But she *is* quick on her feet, throwing a second question at you immediately.\n\n&quot;Well I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t want to be paid for such an enjoyable experience, right?  Right!&quot;\n\nYou had not even stopped shaking your head, but she uses that, slapping you roughly on the back.  &quot;Well, we will call it even then!  Thank you for volunteering, you&#39;ve been such a doll.  But I must focus on the others now, of course.  You understand?&quot;\n\nYou don&#39;t, but she doesn&#39;t give you the time to explain that.  Instead you&#39;re pushed back towards the crowd, who now surges forward, several of them voicing questions.  Between the slave and your own performance, it appears the sales pitch has gone quite well.  And you didn&#39;t get a credit for it.\n\n[[Damn woman.

  "ApproDose3": "&quot;Mmmmgh...&quot;\n\nThe slave at your side had emerged from her stupor just enough to moan once more, shaking masked head.  Was she... trying to warn you?  Its a question you ponder even as the saleswoman raises the mask once more to your face, you inhale again, and such concerns grow distant.  Quiet.  The slave&#39;s struggling seems like a foggy memory as you play with your breasts, and the saleswoman takes you by the shoulders.  She says something to you, something about &#39;getting you suited&#39;, but you&#39;re hardly paying attention.  Instead you allow your body to feel *everything* you could ever want.  All of it pleasurable.  Even as you&#39;re led into the back area of the shop itself, as you&#39;re ushered towards a familiar looking device, as you sign a... contract of some sort?  You begin playing with your cunt again afterward, blissfully lost in the haze.  A mechanical arm stops you eventually, joined by others that grip you.\n\n[[You&#39;re in.... a wardrobe device.-&gt;ApproDose4]]",

Strangely, you find your vision harshly confined.  You&#39;re looking through... a visor, of some sort.  A mask.  You&#39;re masked.  With bleary eyes, you look down upon what your desires have wrought.\n\nYou&#39;re dressed in laminate from head to toe, tight black laminate that covers your every curve, a full body embrace of glossy, smooth material.  It cups your breasts perfectly, your nipples evident through the thin material, while the corset just beneath draws your waist in sharply.  It is laced harshly, giving you a wasp-like look that only serves to emphasize your chest and hips.  Sharp stiletto heels are visible upon your feet, black boots that are in a strange position-- although it takes your addled mind a moment to understand why.  Your legs are up and spread, strapped into place upon a pair of leg rests.  Not just strapped, actually.  *Locked* into place, a fate your wrists share as well, although the chains linking them to the reclining chair upon which you sit are longer, allowing you some freedom of movement.  You can reach your breasts, and your cunt, but not actually escape, something you confirm by pulling sharply against your bondage.\n\n&quot;Mmmmmhhh...&quot;  The response to your efforts come to your right, which you turn to look towards, your mask&#39;s extremely limited field of view making it difficult.  But you manage, only to find a mirror image of... yourself.  A woman in black, bound to a chair, masked and legs spread.  The slave from before, looking at you now.  You cannot see her gaze any more than she can see yours, but you can follow her focus along the tubes running from her mask, to a large bottle upon the table between you, along another set of tubes that... that connect directly to your mask.\n\n[[The slave from before, masked and bound.  You&#39;re just like her now.-&gt;ApproDose5]]",
  "ApproDose5": "&lt;img alt=&quot;purpy&quot; src=&quot;images/reg/purpy.jpg&quot;/&gt;\n\n&quot;Ah, there we are.&quot;  \n\nThe saleswoman steps up between your legs, taking full advantage of your helplessness.  Even so, you try to defend yourself, achieving little beyond the snap of your wrist restraints going taut.  She responds with that dangerous smile, even as she presses her hand between your legs-- into the bright purple pussy lips there.  If the other slave&#39;s had been somehow real is revealed to be false, you don&#39;t feed anything from the set between your own legs, but you *do* feel something else just behind.  A shifting of something inside you, filling your holes, front and back.\n\n&quot;I find, when acquiring fresh assistants, that I need to explain things a few times before they remember them.  So... I see you&#39;re enjoying your new suit?  Heh.  The purple lips are just for show, makes for a better performance when you start rubbing them.  But you *are* plugged beneath them, obviously.  Thick laminate cocks, installed right in your holes.  So you will feel something when you rub.  A little reward for volunteering, although I suppose that would be lying-- they&#39;re required of slave suits.  Which you agreed to wear for me.  Isn&#39;t that nice?&quot;\n\n[[No!-&gt;Dose6]]\n[[Y-Yes...-&gt;Dose6]]",
  "Dose6": "Your answer comes out as little more than a muffled moan, the gag installed beneath your heavy mask making speech an impossibility.  The saleswoman, your... captor?  If she was telling the truth about a contract, she could be anything to you now.  Whatever the case may be, she pats your thigh gently as a gesture is thrown over her shoulder.  She indicates a garage-like door, a veil that had been drawn between the street and your current predicament.  Presumably she had closed temporarily to get you outfitted.  Now that you are, her wicked smile returns.\n\n&quot;Ready to go on display, girls?  I&#39;d tell you to remember that wet and horny makes my sales, but I&#39;m sure you will have that covered soon enough.&quot;  The woman to your side, sharing in your predicament, pulls against her bindings in a show of disagreement-- much like the one you had witnessed upon first approaching.  A response is provided in much the same manner too, a click of a button drawing up the door as the saleswoman moves into the space between your restraint chair and the other slave&#39;s.  Her hand settles upon the control nozzle of the large aphrodisiac bottle there.  Looming over you, her fingers dance upon the spigot.\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t worry.  Just take a deep breath... and do what comes naturally to a laminate slut.&quot;\n\n[[And with that, she twists the control spigot.-&gt;Dose7]]",
  "Dose7": "&quot;Mmmmmgh!&quot;  The slave across from you fights anew against her restraints, but finds them just as tight as your own.  You can move your arms a bit, but your legs are locked firmly into place, spread wide to reveal the false pussy there, bright purple lips on full display to the Torean street that greets you with the rising door.  Perhaps it was your partner&#39;s moan, or maybe just the nature of of your predicament, but you quickly draw a crowd.  Men and women both, although far more of the latter as was common upon Torei, come to hear the saleswoman&#39;s pitch anew.\n\nYou, however, have been holding your breath.  Even so you can already feel the gas running up from the bottle, through the tubes attached to your mask, to linger just outside your nose.  It tingles, a brief promise of what was in store.  Just what are you going to do?  You can&#39;t hold your breath *forever*.\n\n[[Yes you can!  Hold your breath!-&gt;HoldBreath]]\n[[Its no use.  Breathe.

A few tourists, always easily identified by the textiles they wear, or the occasional bit of laminate, are even pointing at you-- or perhaps more accurately, pointing at the space between your legs.  To this engorged lips, on full display for all to see.\n\n[[Keep holding your breath!-&gt;HoldBreath2]]\n[[What&#39;s the point?  Take a breath.  A deep one.-&gt;DeepBreathEarly]]",

You cannot remove the mask, nor unlock yourself.  There is no escaping what you&#39;re about to undergo, so why not just get it over with?  You do just that with a long, deep breath.  A tingling sensation begins even before you&#39;re done, starting in your throat and running down into your lungs.  The scent is sweet, but the feeling is *warm*, a full-bodied experience that sees you panting gently before you even realize just what was occurring.  A few moments later and your chained wrists move, using the full travel allowed them to touch your own breasts.  You may have a crowd watching you, but they seem so distant now as you stare vacantly upward, reveling in just how wonderful your sensitive nipples feel in that moment.  But your gloved hands cannot achieve enough there, and soon they&#39;re slipping downward, trailing along your tightly corseted waist, until they reach the meeting of your laminated thighs.  Your plugged holes await, your fingers unable to access them, but still capable of pressing into their bases, kneading them, shifting the bulbous cocks deep within you.  \n\nAs you moan lewdly, playing with your plugs, the crowd before you is treated to something else-- namely the sight of you rubbing fiercely at the faux lips of the violently purple cunt fixed between your legs.  Its a display that elicits a purr of surprise, while the saleswoman watches with eager anticipation.  At your side however, the other restrained woman, still holding her breath, watches your early descent into depravity with what you can only imagine to be shock beneath the featureless black of her mask.  \n\n[[But it feels so good!-&gt;SlaveFero]]",
  "EscapeChair": "There had to be *some* escape from this chair.  Gamely you pull against your restraints, testing each of them for any hint of give.  You&#39;re due for bad news.  Those linking your wrists to the short chains upon the chair prove just as sturdy as the simpler set locking your legs to the rests, wide and apart.   At your side your partner appears to be doing the same, but your captor hardly seems to mind-- she&#39;s still just setting the crowd up for the presentation, introducing her product.  Even so, most eyes are firmly upon you.

  "HoldBreath2": "Grimly you hold your breath, even as your lungs start to burn.  For once your bondage seems to help, however, the sensation of your pinned legs and restrained arms somehow making it easier to endure.  You do pull at the cuffs though, wriggling in your chair.  Its a state your fellow captive slips into as well, her black laminate gleaming with every shake of her chest and pull against her predicament.  You&#39;re trapped here, together, quickly running out of time.  And that ticking clock runs out for the other woman first.\n\nYou&#39;re close enough to hear her gasping breath, presumably drawn entirely through her nose given her gag.  The gurgle of the bottle between you announces the aphrodisiac within going to work.  Her struggling slows, the momentarily ceases, her gagged growls replaced by a quiet by growing *moan.*  She was feeling now, each following breath furthering her descent into debauchery.  \n\nIt starts small, the hands that had been resting on her corseted waist drifting upward, fondling her impressive chest.  Your captor, the saleswoman, notes the change with approval to the crowd, as most eyes turn to watch.  It doesn&#39;t take long now, mere minutes, before the captive&#39;s gloved fingers wander down to the meeting of her thighs, maxing out the liberty provided by her wrist chains, to press into the violently purple lips there.  You know from your own suit that they were merely for a show, a facsimile, but in her hunt to apply further pressure to the plugs *beneath*, she rubs at the fake cunt with enough enthusiasm to clearly woo the crowd.\n\nMoaning and rubbing and putting on quite a show, your lungs burn anew with each aphro-laced breath you hear her draw.\n\n[[HOLD YOUR BREATH!-&gt;HoldBreath3]]\n[[What&#39;s the point?

Beside you, the other woman rubs at her false cunt eagerly, moaning like a bitch in heat.  But you take most satisfaction in the saleswoman who stands above you, waiting impatiently for your resistance to end.  Her frown is shielded by a turn away from the watching crowd, but by the way she checks the timepiece on the wall, you definitely get the sense you&#39;ve at least inconvenienced her.\n\nIn the end, however, it is your body that breaks before your will.  With your lungs starved for air, with your very vision dimming as your brain screamed for oxygen, some primordial defense mechanism finally engages.  In a coughing gasp you suddenly draw in your first breath before you can reassert control over yourself, but by then its too late.  The glorious taste of oxygen overwhelms you as readily as the sweet taste of the air, a trait you explore further as the dam of your resistance breaks fully, and you finally breath deeply.  A tingling sensation begins even before you&#39;re done, starting in your throat and running down into your lungs.

At your side however, the other restrained woman turns her head, looking at you for a long moment.  She has no face to emote, and the gags you both wear prevent the exchange of words, yet nevertheless you sense an understanding there.  It doesn&#39;t take long before you&#39;re rubbing just as fiercely as she is, wet and moaning.\n\n[[But it feels so good!-&gt;SlaveFero]]",
  "SlaveFero": "&lt;img alt=&quot;monger&quot; src=&quot;images/reg/monger.jpg&quot;/&gt;\n\n&quot;And now you see it!&quot;  Standing between the two chairs, the saleswoman rests a hand on your head as she does the same with the other woman.  &quot;The strength of Instant Heat!  These two sluts will want nothing more than to cum for as long as their supply of the aphrodisiac holds out.  Ah!  But they *like* this.  Both these girls are slaves, after all.  Have you noted their uniforms?  For those new to Torei, these are standardized slave uniforms, and these sort are *always* thinking with their cunts.  Instant Heat just ensures that is *all* they think with!&quot;\n\nTurning to you, she leans over your restrained body, her bright smile so eager.  &quot;Isn&#39;t that right, slave?  Tell them how you&#39;re enjoying yourself.&quot;\n\n[[&quot;Mmmmmmmmmmgh!&quot;-&gt;SlaveFero2]]\n[[&quot;Mmmgh, mmgh, mmmmmmmmgh!&quot;-&gt;SlaveFero2]]\n[[&quot;Mmmmgh...&quot;-&gt;SlaveFero2]]",

While I wouldn&#39;t recommend indulging as deeply as these slaves, even you tourists can enjoy a bottle.  Explore the experience that only ultimate ecstasy can provide!  I can assure you, my prices are so low they should be criminal.&quot;\n\nShe&#39;s already making several sales as she continues, speaking further on the product.  Keeping track of her words proves harder and harder, however, as every breath draws a fresh dose of Instant Heat into your mask.  You rub harder at your plugs, feeling them shift within your cunt and rear, the former so wet by now.  You *do* want nothing more than to cum.  Several times you think you&#39;re about to achieve just that, the wave of pleasure between your legs cresting as you rub furiously at the purple lips there, and yet... every time you come up just short.\n\n&quot;I think she&#39;s starting to realize the *other* feature of Instant Heat,&quot; the saleswoman announces from your side.  Even in the madness of your sex-fogged mind, confusion still manages to break through.  What did she mean by *other feature*?  Thankfully the saleswoman seemed to enjoy talking, and is quick to continue.\n\n&quot;While you are all purchasing the regular formulation of Instant Heat, my two girls here are using the Slave variant.  Unfortunately for them... it includes an orgasm inhibitor.  They will *never* climax while under its influence!&quot;\n\n[[Nooooo!-&gt;SlaveFero3]]\n[[That bitch!-&gt;SlaveFero3]]",
  "SlaveFero3": "You have to admit: the saleswoman&#39;s product is at least effective, and with your help she certainly seems to sell a lot of it.  You&#39;re not sure how much, your attention lapses frequently as your rub at your plugs, desperately seeking a release you&#39;re somehow incapable of achieving.  As long as your mask is hooked to that large bottle, your world is little more than that sweet scent, the fire between your legs, and the writhing of your body.  \n\nIt makes the sudden *click* of the bottle&#39;s nozzle being turned off a surprise, although it still takes you a few minutes to come down from the haze of pleasure enough to even realize exactly what was occurring.  To your surprise you find the shutters closed on the shop, the crowd gone, and your captor leaning against a cart stocked with more of her product nearby.  It takes even *longer* for you to glance at the walls surrounding you, now that her posters have been pulled down.  They seem to be for... a food service of some sort?  \n\n&quot;Its... not really my shop,&quot; the still unnamed woman announces, clearly having followed your gaze around the room.  Moving behind you, her hands start working at the various buckles and locks around your head.  &quot;So I&#39;m going to be leaving, Miss... hmm.  I suppose I never got your name?  Well, still-- I must thank you for being such a wonderful assistant today.  Your little show earned me a great deal of credits.&quot;\n\nShe smiles at that, the expression far less aggressive than the one she had worn while drawing you into your current predicament.  Unsnapping the last seal on your mask, she pulls it up, allowing her to pull the gag from your mouth.  You&#39;re barely given a moment to stretch your jaw before she&#39;s sliding your regulator mask back down, returning you to total laminate closure.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m actually tempted to take you with me, you know.

So I&#39;m going to set your locks to undo themselves in... fifteen minutes?  Enough time for me to get away.  You can scream if you like, but I wouldn&#39;t recommend it-- being found in such a compromising position could get you in an entirely new sort of trouble.  Got it?

What greets you at first appears to be an animal, a horse by its maned head, but the proportions are all wrong.  So very... human, of the masculine variety.\n\nIt was a suit!  A full body suit of black laminate, merely featuring a molded horse-like mask, into which heavy tubes are plugged.  A collar at the throat makes it obvious you&#39;re looking at a slave, while the heavy laminate harness wrapping its body suggests what such a person was used for-- pulling the carriages utilized to move people and cargo!  Hooved boots force the male up onto his toes, but its the space between his legs that draws your attention as you gaze back upward.  His manhood is covered of course, but the material of his suit bulges out at that point as if to draw attention to the lack of access, so smooth and useless.\n\n&quot;Mmmmmmggggh...&quot;  His half moan, half grunt, is as masculine as its tortured with unsatisfied lust, although it takes several pacing movements of the creature for you to recognize a pink canister screwed onto those tubes on each side of the mask.

If it could not be fucking, as that so very full, potent, and *useless* bulge indicated, perhaps it simply wanted to be working out the frustration through labor.  *Hard* labor, if the heavy loads that occupied the warehouse portion of this place indicated.\n\nHow many slaves did they keep like this, in perpetual bondage and lust, downright *eager* to be placed into the harness and... what, whipped and forced to pull carriages?  What would it feel like to *be* one, a mare, kept in similar circumstances?

His hoof-like hands are rather useless for such things anyway, and he&#39;s hardly got the wherewithal to consider other options as the pheromones overtake him.

Its so hard to tell with that mask he wore.

Offworlder preconceptions, things like dignity and morality, meant so very little while locked in laminate, when one&#39;s own body turned against them.

Just what that *meant* isn&#39;t exactly clear, but looking at the ring gag forcing his mouth open, you can make a pretty good guess.  \n\nMichael however doesn&#39;t want to hear it-- or is simply in denial.

  "DDAdmit6": "As you tug a bit experimentally at the jacket, the heavy laminate proving quite secure, you almost don&#39;t notice the Wardrobe circling back up towards your throat.  Your head is still bared, a welcome respite, but fresh layers of gleaming white laminate are applied to your neck in several layers.  A rather utilitarian collar is formed, several metal attachment points being sunk into the freshly printed material.  The foremost, directly beneath your chin, is furthered with a small identifying tag.  At the moment you have no means of observing it further.\n\n&lt;img alt=&quot;ddcollar&quot; src=&quot;images/gear/ddcollar.png&quot;/&gt;\n(if: not ($Inv contains &quot;patient collar&quot;))[(set: $Inv to $Inv + (a: &quot;patient collar&quot;))]\n(color: red)[Patient Collar equipped!]\n\nJust as soon as the printing halo finished it raced downward, to your bare feet.

That was perhaps the Wardrobe&#39;s greatest trick, not only working in such a detail orientated medium, but doing it all while you blinked and squirmed and opened your mouth at will.  Despite your efforts it concludes rather quickly, leaving you with red lips and an understated, but quite alluring, shading of your eyes, contouring of your cheeks, and the abolishment of any visual flaws.  \n\nAnd just like that, the process concludes.  The arms holding you aloft allow you to descend, and once your new socks found the floor they retreat entirely.

Once again her large bosom is all but pushed into your face, a side effect of her sheer proportions as she moved about the wheelchair, securing you to it with a handful of tactically placed straps.\n\n&quot;First rule for *you* is that restraints are for your benefit, $Patient.  They will only make you feel better after enough treatment, and until then you must simply trust in our methods.  There we go.&quot;  She tugs once more on a strap holding your leg in place, then runs her gloved fingers through your hair.

Nurse Joy emerges soon after, locking the door behind her, before pushing you to the hall&#39;s last-- and now only open-- door.  \n\n&quot;Welcome home, $Patient,&quot; she coos, before rolling you into a remarkably small room.  There are no shelves or fittings, no decorations or vid-screens.  All you&#39;re presented with is a stark white cell, matching the coloration of your uniform, broken into squares of a soft, semi-pliable material.  The only piece of furniture is a small bed in the corner, its sheeting more white laminate.\n\n&quot;Familiarity and routine will be just as important to your treatment as the more... physical aspects of the experience, so we do keep a strict schedule.  You will be fed twice a day, once in the morning, once in the evening.  An hour each day in the sun room, with communal time occasionally.  Visitors are permitted only a handful of times of year.&quot;\n\nFreed, you stand up, the laminate socks you wore sinking softly into the padded floor.  Wheeling the chair out, Nurse Joy returns to tap one of the squared panels near the wall.  Surprisingly it dances with color, before settling into a familiar shape-- that pyramid she had demonstrated in the elevator-- and a handful of other biometrics below.\n\n&quot;As I said, we believe our patients should direct their treatment... to a limited extent.  You will find information on yourself located here, updated daily.&quot;  She leans out into the hall, as if checking something.  \n\n&quot;And I believe that&#39;s all for now, $Patient.  I know you have had a long day, so I&#39;ll let you get settled.  I&#39;ll be back first thing in the morning to get you started on your medication, and then your first treatment...&quot;\n\nAnd with that, the heavy padded door is closed.  Deep below the streets of Torei, locked into a straitjacket, sealed inside a padded cell, you contemplate your choices.  Had you made a wrong step along the way, or had you *wanted* this?  Whatever the cause, you&#39;re certainly...\n\n[[...lost in laminate now.-&gt;RoomFirstExam]]",
  "RoomFirstExam": "&lt;img alt=&quot;ddcell&quot; src=&quot;images/land/ddcell.png&quot;/&gt;\n\nTurning around, you take a deep breath-- as much as your corset would allow-- and notice how the scent of laminate permeates *everything*.  The walls were made of the stuff, as was your clothing, and the bed.  Torei&#39;s favorite material certainly had seemingly limitless uses.\n\nYou also notice just how exhausted you were- it had to be near dawn already, although Nurse Joy had made no mention of it.  Given your cell lacked windows, and indeed the entire ward was deep underground, you&#39;re not even sure Docile Dolls worked off a normal schedule.  There is no clock, and even the small display near the door gave zero indication of time.\n\nThinking of that display, however, you glance about.

A tight laminate straitjacket, hugging your every curve and prominently demonstrating your breasts.  Beneath that, a corset, more felt than seen, with A catsuit beneath that, running down to your sock-covered feet.  \n\nAnd you&#39;re supposed to wear this, constantly, for weeks?  How was that even possible?  Torean laminate was often intended for long-term wear, you knew that, but even so the simple *prospect* of doing so nearly boggled the mind.

There would be no escaping this room, you realize that immediately-- even if you weren&#39;t bound and uniformed.  You try to imagine wandering out onto the streets like this.  Had you witnessed such a person just this morning, you may have returned them to the Clinic yourself!\n\nThe only thing of interest you do note are a series of small, rounded aberrations in the seam between walls and ceiling.  *Cameras*, you realize after a few moments consideration.  You had seen there were active cameras on those panels outside of the room, and the Nurses probably monitored patients in other ways.\n\nIt was quite invasive to consider, really.

There are clearly several points intended for hooking or locking other things to, perhaps straps, and an even more elaborate mounting point about halfway down that you can&#39;t figure a cause for.  \n\nDespite it all, however, it does look quite comfortable.

Nor do the straps budge-- they were seamlessly fused with your suit, after all, and the buckles were clearly quite secure.  The best you can do is shift it around a bit, feeling the barest of movement between the jacket and catsuit.  What that actually accomplishes, however, is nothing more than working up a bit of a sweat.\n\nAnd, of course, it caused the pair of straps that ran between your legs to rub frustratingly there.  \n\n[[Try to... play with yourself.-&gt;WardExamPlay]]\n[[Examine the wall display.-&gt;WardExamDisplay]]\n[[Examine the cell.-&gt;WardExamCell]]\n[[Examine the bed.-&gt;WardExamBed]]",

It had been black, of a similar look to your Black Card.  Mentioning it to the Mistress invokes an immediate interest, and a response.\n\n&quot;Remarkable.  This is more involved than I thought.  What you witnessed, if you must know, was something we call a *Daemon Door.*  Torei, this planet, is riddled with tunnels dating back to the initial formation of the planet.  Barely 1% have been found and mapped however, because the AIs still use them-- mostly to transfer water and materials as they continue their terraforming project, but also to move Daemons.&quot;\n\nHer professorial bent is furthered by the way she leans forward, as if in mid-lecture.  &quot;Daemon Doors, tunnels leading to the surface, are barely more than a myth however.  They are said to appear and disappear at random, which the uneducated suggest involves something like magic, but is really due to the skill the AIs have in tunneling.  I was actually initially called in by the owner of this building to examine one that exists here, in the backrooms of the Club.  Anyway--&quot;\n\nShe lowers her voice.  &quot;The woman you met, who used the door... she must have been a Daemon Worshipper.  They are rare, particularly in equatorial ringdoms like this, but their covens are known to exist.  It is an unstated fact on Torei that worshipping the AIs, as Toreans did at the dawn of their civilization, can bring all sorts of rewards... but the research there is limited.  More often than not, the Daemons come for them despite the worship.  Undoubtedly they&#39;re converted into all sorts of terrible things at that point.  Mute Ravishers, Custodians, perhaps just basic testing stock... the AI are cruel masters.&quot;\n(set: $DDoor to 50)\n[[&quot;She said she might contact me again.&quot;-&gt;DDoorAgain]]\n[[&quot;So she helped me in the storm because...?&quot;-&gt;DDoorStorm]]\n[[&quot;Is Daemon Worship legal?&quot;-&gt;DDoorWorship]]\n[[&quot;Thanks for the info...&quot;-&gt;SargonHub]]",

In this case fiber-like extrusions of heavy duty laminate are twisted together before being coated in a much thinner outer layer, providing strength and a smooth texture perfect for binding.

(color: red)[MALICE]-brand literature often recommends pairing these undergarments with a skirt short enough to show them off, or a chastity belt for those girls unable to keep their hands to themselves.*",

Demonstrative of that claim, this set of two wrist cuffs, two ankle cuffs, and a matching collar are very heavy, rendered in a thick gauge of pure Torean steel burnished bright white, the hardware loops hanging off of it providing a contrast with their more polished design.  The clinking of metal on metal accompanies every movement of the wearer, and of course they are nigh-indestructible.*",

Outwardly appearing to both gag and blind the wearer, both are only technically true.  Wearers will note that they can see from within, through a series of micropreforations that provide something like a (much reduced) means of viewing the world outside the mask.  The gag meanwhile is integrated, a deep-throat model through which a breeding tube is embedded to allow for limited breathing.\n\nPerhaps most notably however, a throat-mic is built into the lower portion of the neck of the mask.  By catching the vibrations of the wearer&#39;s throat, it can replicate the intended words even if the gag allows for little actual speech.*",

The locking blindfold is removable but does feature micro-perforations to allow limited sight even when in-place.  In much the same manner the panel gag, a deep-throating phallic design with breathing tube driven through the core of the device, can be paired with the throat-mic built into the posture-style collar to allow limited speech.*",
